# This is a sample key sequence definition file.  It is used by Lynx when
# built with ncurses or slang, to augment the definitions from your terminal's
# termcap or terminfo description.

# (Lynx implements this mechanism only if USE_KEYMAPS is defined during
# compilation, which has nothing to do with the KEYMAP directives in lynx.cfg,
# see source file LYCurses.h.)

# Lines that start with a '#' are comment lines.  Blank lines are ignored.

# The 'setkey' function may be used in two ways:
#
#   1.  setkey ESC-SEQUENCE  KEYSYM
#   2.  setkey ESC-SEQUENCE  KEYSYM_NAME
#
# where KEYSYM is an integer.  A keysym is essentially with the lynx.cfg
# file calls a 'keystroke', but I think that keysym is a more appropriate
# name.  The keysym is an integer and may be expressed in various ways:
#
#       as a decimal integer:  97
#       hexadecimal:           0x61
#       Octal:                 0141
#       as an ASCII character: 'a'
#
# Some keysyms may be expressed symbolically as a keysym name using the
# second form.  The currently recognized symbolic names are:
#
#       UPARROW
#       DNARROW
#       RTARROW
#       LTARROW
#       PGDOWN
#       PGUP
#       HOME
#       END
#       F1
#       DO_KEY
#       FIND_KEY
#       SELECT_KEY
#       INSERT_KEY
#       REMOVE_KEY
#       DO_NOTHING
#
# It does not matter if your keyboard does not have some of the keys
# implied by the above names.  The fact is that lynx uses these keys as an
# an intermediate representation.
#
# The ESC-SEQUENCE should be enclosed in double quotes.  The '^' character
# is special and indicates a control character, e.g., ^K is Ctrl-K.  An ESC
# character (ascii 27) may be represented as ^[.  As an example, many
# terminals have arrow keys that emit 'ESC [ A' for the UP arrow.  This may
# be represented as the escape sequence "^[[A".  The default keymapping is
# given below:
#
setkey "\033[A"		UPARROW
setkey "\033OA"		UPARROW
setkey "\033[B"		DNARROW
setkey "\033OB"		DNARROW
setkey "\033[C"		RTARROW
setkey "\033OC"		RTARROW
setkey "\033[D"		LTARROW
setkey "\033OD"		LTARROW
setkey "\033[1~"	FIND_KEY
setkey "\033[2~"	INSERT_KEY
setkey "\033[3~"	REMOVE_KEY
setkey "\033[4~"	SELECT_KEY
setkey "\033[5~"	PGUP
setkey "\033[6~"	PGDOWN
setkey "\033[8~"	END
setkey "\033[7~"	HOME
setkey "\033[28~"	F1
setkey "\033[29~"	DO_KEY
#
# All other keys map to themselves, e.g,
#
setkey "a"		'a'
#
# Now suppose that your terminal produces different escape sequences for
# HOME and END.  In particular, suppose that the home key produces 'ESC [
# H' and that the end key produces 'ESC [ K'.  Then these may be defined to
# map to lynx HOME and END keys via
#
setkey "^[[H"		HOME
setkey "^[[K"		END
#
# Similarly, we may map emacs-like sequences to these functions:
#
setkey "^[<"		HOME
setkey "^[>"		END
#
# Note that it may be impossible to map several sequences to the same
# keysym (NCURSES only?), in that case the mapping occurring last wins.
#
# The following maps a sequence commonly used for Shift+Tab to the
# corresponding code.  It should not be needed if the terminfo file
# has the correct info for kcbt.
#
setkey "^[[Z"		0x10F
#
# Other special escapes:
#	\a		bell
#	\b		backspace
#	\f		form-feed
#	\n		newline (line-feed)
#	\r		carriage-return
#	\t		tab
#	\v		vertical tab
#	\<number>	octal number, up to 3 digits, e.g., "\033".
#	\d<number>	decimal number, up to 3 digits, e.g., "\d99"
#	\x<number>	hexidecimal number, up to 2 digits, e.g., "\xFF"
#
# For Unix-systems (which have termcap or terminfo) you may also use symbols
# that refer to the termcap/terminfo, by referencing the name bracketed by
# "^(" and ")", e.g.,
setkey "^(cuu1)"	UPARROW
setkey "^(up)"		UPARROW
