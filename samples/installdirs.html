<!-- This is an example file for the Lynx dired "install" functionality.
     Lynx needs to be compiled with dired support and OK_INSTALL defined.
     For the dired "install" function to work, this file has to exist
     in the HOME directory under the name ".installdirs.html" or (for
     8+3, i.e. DOS-like, filesystems) "instdirs.htm".
