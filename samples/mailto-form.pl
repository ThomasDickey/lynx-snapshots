# Some scripts for handling mailto URLs within lynx via an interactive form
# 
# Warning: this is a quick demo, to show what kinds of things are possible
# by hooking some external commands into lynx.  Use at your own risk.
# 
# Requirements:
# 
# - Perl and CGI.pm.
# - A "sendmail" command for actually sending mail (if you need some
#   other interface, change the code below in sub sendit appropriately).
# - Lynx compiled with support for lynxcgi, that means EXEC_CGI must have
#   been defined at compilation, usually done with
#     ./configure --enable-cgi-links
# - Lynx must have support for CERN-style rules as of 2.8.3, which must
#   not have been disabled at compilation (it is enabled by default).
# 
# Instructions:
# (This is for people without lynxcgi experience; if you are already
# use lynxcgi, you don't have to follow everything literally, use
# common sense for picking appropriate file locations in your situation.)
# 
# - Make a subdirectory 'lynxcgi' under you home directory, i.e.
#      mkdir ~/lynxcgi
# - Put this three script file mailto-form.pl there and make it
#   executable.  For example,
#      cp mailto-form.pl ~/lynxcgi
#      chmod a+x ~/lynxcgi/mailto-form.pl
# - Edit mailto-form.pl (THIS FILE), there are some strings that
#   that need to be changed, see ### Configurable variables ###
#   below.
# - Allow lynx to execute lynxcgi files in that directory, for example,
#   put in your lynx.cfg file:
#      TRUSTED_LYNXCGI:<tab>/home/myhomedir/lynxcgi/mailto-form.pl
#   where <tab> is a real TAB character and you have to put the real
#   location of your directory in place of "myhomedir", of course.
#   The '~' abbreviation cannot be used.
#   You could also just enable execution of all lynxcgi scripts, by
#   not having any TRUSTED_LYNXCGI options in lynx.cfg at all, but
#   that can't be recommended.
# - Tell lynx to actually use the lynxcgi scripts for mailto URLs.
#   There are two variants:
#   a) Redirect "mailto"
#   Requires patched lynx, currently not yet in the developent code.
#   Use the following two lines in the file that is configured as
#   RULESFILE in lynxcfg:
#      PermitRedirection mailto:*
#      Redirect mailto:* lynxcgi:/home/myhomedir/lynxcgi/mailto-form.pl?from=myname@myhost&to=*
#   You can also put them directly in lynx.cfg, prefixing each with
#   "RULE:".  Replace ""myhomedir", "myname", and "myhost" with your
#   correct values, of course.
#   b) Redirect "xmailto"
#   Requires defining a fake proxy before starting lynx, like
#      export xmailto_proxy=dummy  # or for csh: setenv xmailto_proxy dummy
#   Requires that you change "mailto" to "xmailto" each time you want
#   to activate a mailto link.  This can be done conveniently with
#   a few keys: 'E', ^A, 'x', Enter.
#   Use the following two lines in the file that is configured as
#   RULESFILE in lynxcfg:
#      PermitRedirection xmailto:*
#      Redirect xmailto:* lynxcgi:/home/myhomedir/lynxcgi/mailto-form.pl?from=myname@myhost&to=*
#   You can also put them directly in lynx.cfg, prefixing each with
#   "RULE:".  Replace ""myhomedir", "myname", and "myhost" with your
#   correct values, of course.
# 
# Limitations:
# 
# - Only applies to mailto URLs that appear as links or are entered at
#   a 'g'oto prompt.  Does not apply to other ways of sending mail, like
#   the 'c' (COMMENT) key, mailto as a FORM action, or mailing a file
#   from the 'P'rinting Options screen.
# - Nothing is done for charset labelling, content-transfer-encoding
#   of non-ASCII characters, and other MIME niceties.

#                           by calling $SENDMAIL instead of just throwing
#                           up a form.  CHANGE IT!  And don't tell anyone!
#                           Treat it like a password.
