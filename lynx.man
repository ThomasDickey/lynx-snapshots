.I
Lynx
is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users
running cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g.,
vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes, or any
other "curses-oriented" display).  It will display hypertext
markup language (HTML) documents containing links to
files residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.
Current versions of
.I
Lynx
run on
Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.
.PP
.I
Lynx
can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or
to build information systems intended primarily for local access.
For example,
.I
Lynx
has been used to build several Campus Wide
Information Systems (CWIS).  In addition,
.I
Lynx
can be used to
build systems isolated within a single LAN.
.SH OPTIONS
At start up, \fILynx\fR will load any local
file or remote URL specified at the command
line.  For help with URLs, press \fB"?"\fR
or \fB"H"\fR while running \fILynx\fR.
Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."
.PP
If more than one local file or remote URL is listed on the command line,
\fILynx\fP will open only the last interactively.
All of the names (local files and remote URLs) are added to the G)oto history.
.PP
\fILynx\fR uses only long option names. Option
names can begin with double dash as well,
underscores and dashes can be intermixed in
option names (in the reference below options
are with one dash before them and with underscores).
.PP
\fILynx\fR provides many command-line options.
Some options require a value (string, number or keyword).
These are noted in the reference below.
The other options set boolean values in the program.
There are three types of boolean options: set, unset and toggle.
If no option value is given, these have the obvious meaning:
set (to true), unset (to false), or toggle (between true/false).
For any of these, an explicit value can be given in different
forms to allow for operating system constraints,
e.g.,
.RS
.nf
\fB-center:off\fP
\fB-center=off\fP
\fB-center-\fP
.fi
.RE
\fILynx\fR recognizes
"1", "+", "on" and "true" for true values, and
"0", "-", "off" and "false" for false values.
Other option-values are ignored.
.PP
The default boolean, number and string option values that are compiled
into lynx are displayed in the help-message provided by \fBlynx -help\fP.
Some of those may differ according to how lynx was built;
see the help message itself for these values.
The \fB-help\fP option is processed before any option, including those
that control reading from the lynx.cfg file.
Therefore runtime configuration values are not reflected in the help-message.
.TP
.B \-
If the argument is only '-', then Lynx expects to receive
the arguments from the standard input.  This is to allow for the
potentially very long command line that can be associated
with the \fB\-get_data\fR or \fB\-post_data\fR arguments (see below).
It can also be used to avoid having sensitive information
in the invoking command line (which would be visible to
other processes on most systems), especially when
the \fB\-auth\fR or \fB\-pauth\fR options are used.
.TP
.B \-accept_all_cookies
accept all cookies.
.TP
.B \-anonymous
apply restrictions for anonymous account, see also \fB\-restrictions\fR.
.TP
.B \-assume_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
charset for documents that don't specify it.
.TP
.B \-assume_local_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
charset assumed for local files,
i.e., files which lynx creates such as internal pages for the options menu.
.TP
.B \-assume_unrec_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
use this instead of unrecognized charsets.
.TP
.B \-auth\fR=\fIID\fR:\fIPASSWD
set authorization ID and password for protected documents
at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files which use
this switch.
.TP
.B \-base
prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html
outputs for \fB\-source\fR dumps.
.TP
.B \-bibp\fR=\fIURL
specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).
.TP
.B \-blink
forces high intensity background colors for color mode, if available
and supported by the terminal.
This applies to the \fBslang\fR library (for a few terminal emulators),
or to OS/2 EMX with \fBncurses\fR.
.TP
.B \-book
use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
line startfile is still set for the Main screen command, and will
be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
.TP
.B \-buried_news
toggles scanning of news articles for buried references, and
converts them to news links.  Not recommended because email
addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to
false news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.
.TP
.B \-cache\fR=\fINUMBER
set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.
The default is 10.
.TP
.B \-case
enable case-sensitive string searching.
.TP
.B \-center
Toggle center alignment in HTML TABLE.
.TP
.B \-cfg\fR=\fIFILENAME
specifies a Lynx configuration file other than the default
lynx.cfg.
.TP
.B \-child
exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk.
.TP
.B \-cmd_log\fR=\fIFILENAME
write keystroke commands and related information to the specified file.
.TP
.B \-cmd_script\fR=\fIFILENAME
read keystroke commands from the specified file.
You can use the data written using the \fB\-cmd_log\fR option.
Lynx will ignore other information which the command-logging may have
written to the logfile.
Each line of the command script contains either a comment beginning with "#",
or a keyword:
.RS 5
.TP 5
exit
causes the script to stop, and forces \fILynx\fP to exit immediately.
.TP
key
the character value, in printable form.
Cursor and other special keys are given as names, e.g., "Down Arrow".
Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is,
and hexadecimal values represent other 8-bit codes.
.TP
set
followed by a "name=value" allows one to override values set in the
lynx.cfg file.
.RE
.TP
.B \-color
forces color mode on, if available.  Default color control sequences
which work for many terminal types are assumed if the terminal
capability description does not specify how to handle color.
Lynx needs to be compiled with the \fBslang\fR library for this flag,
it is equivalent to setting the \fBCOLORTERM\fR environment variable.
(If color support is instead provided by a color-capable curses
library like \fBncurses\fR, Lynx relies completely on the terminal
description to determine whether color mode is possible, and
this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)
A saved show_color=always setting found in a .lynxrc file at
startup has the same effect.  A saved show_color=never found
in .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
.TP
.B \-connect_timeout\fR=\fIN
Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.
.TP
.B \-cookie_file\fR=\fIFILENAME
specifies a file to use to read cookies.
If none is specified, the default value is ~/.lynx_cookies
for most systems, but ~/cookies for MS-DOS.
.TP
.B \-cookie_save_file\fR=\fIFILENAME
specifies a file to use to store cookies.
If none is specified, the value given by
\fB-cookie_file\fR is used.
.TP
.B \-cookies
toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.
.TP
.B \-core
toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.
Turn this option off to ask \fILynx\fP to force a core dump if a fatal error occurs.
.TP
.B \-crawl
with \fB\-traversal,\fR output each page to a file.
with \fB\-dump\fR, format output as with \fB\-traversal\fR,
but to the standard output.

mark wrapped lines in interactive session.
.TP
.B \-dump
dumps the formatted output of the default document or those

For example
.sp
.RS
lynx -source . >foo.html
.RE
.IP
generates HTML source listing the files in the current directory.
Each file is marked by an HREF relative to the parent directory.
Add a trailing slash to make the HREF's relative to the current directory:

in turn, starts another Lynx process.)
.TP
.B \-timeout\fR=\fIN
For win32, sets the network read-timeout, where N is given in seconds.
.TP
.B \-tlog
toggles between using a Lynx Trace Log and stderr for trace output
from the session.
.TP
.B \-tna
turns on "Textfields Need Activation" mode.
.TP
.B \-trace
turns on Lynx trace mode.  Destination of trace output depends
on \-tlog.
.TP
.B \-trace_mask\fR=\fIvalue
turn on optional traces, which may result in very large trace files.
Logically OR the values to combine options:
.br
1=SGML character parsing states
.br

.br
4=TRST (table layout)
.br
8=config (lynx.cfg and .lynxrc contents)
.br
16=binary string copy/append, used in form data construction.
.TP
.B \-traversal
traverse all http links derived from startfile.  When used with
-crawl, each link that begins with the same string as startfile
is output to a file, intended for indexing.  See CRAWL.announce
for more information.
.TP
.B trim_input_fields
trim input text/textarea fields in forms.
.TP
.B \-underline_links
toggles use of underline/bold attribute for links.
.TP
.B \-underscore
toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

Clicking the left mouse button on a link traverses it.
Clicking the right mouse button pops back.
Click on the top line to scroll up.
Click on the bottom line to scroll down.
The first few positions in the top and bottom line may invoke
additional functions.
Lynx must be compiled with \fBncurses\fR or \fBslang\fR to support this feature.
If \fBncurses\fR is used, clicking the middle mouse button pops up
a simple menu.  Mouse clicks may only work reliably while Lynx is
idle waiting for input.
.TP

Type \fB"K"\fR for a complete list of the current key-stroke
command mappings.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
In addition to various "standard" environment variables such as
\fBHOME\fR, \fBPATH\fR, \fBUSER\fR, \fBDISPLAY\fR, \fBTMPDIR\fR, \fBetc\fR,
\fILynx\fR utilizes several Lynx-specific environment variables, if they
exist.
.PP
Others may be created or modified by \fILynx\fR to pass data to an external
program, or for other reasons.  These are listed separately below.
.PP
See also the sections on \fBSIMULATED CGI SUPPORT\fR and
\fBNATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\fR, below.
.PP
Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all types of platforms
supported by \fILynx\fR, though most do.  Feedback on platform
dependencies is solicited.
.PP
Environment Variables Used By \fILynx\fR:
.TP 20
.B COLORTERM
If set, color capability for the terminal is forced on at startup time.
The actual value assigned to the variable is ignored.  This variable is
only meaningful if \fILynx\fR was built using the \fBslang\fR
screen-handling library.
.TP
.B LYNX_CFG
This variable, if set, will override the default location and name of
the global configuration file (normally, \fBlynx.cfg\fR) that was defined
by the LYNX_CFG_FILE constant in the userdefs.h file, during installation.
See the userdefs.h file for more information.
.TP
.B LYNX_LOCALEDIR
If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in location of the
locale directory which contains native language (NLS) message text.
.TP
.B LYNX_LSS
This variable, if set, specifies the location of the default \fILynx\fR
character style sheet file.  [Currently only meaningful if \fILynx\fR was
built using experimental color style support.]
.TP
.B LYNX_SAVE_SPACE
This variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for files
saved to disk that is defined in the \fBlynx.cfg SAVE_SPACE:\fR statement.
See the \fBlynx.cfg\fR file for more information.
.TP
.B LYNX_TEMP_SPACE
This variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for temporary
files that was defined during installation, as well as any value that may
be assigned to the \fBTMPDIR\fR variable.
.TP
.B MAIL
This variable specifies the default inbox \fILynx\fR will check for new
mail, if such checking is enabled in the \fBlynx.cfg\fR file.
.TP
.B NEWS_ORGANIZATION
This variable, if set, provides the string used in the \fBOrganization:\fR
header of \fBUSENET\fR news postings.  It will override the setting of the
ORGANIZATION environment variable, if it is also set (and, on \fBUNIX\fR,
the contents of an /etc/organization file, if present).
.TP
.B NNTPSERVER
If set, this variable specifies the default NNTP server that will be used
for \fBUSENET\fR news reading and posting with \fILynx\fR, via news: URL's.
.TP
.B ORGANIZATION
This variable, if set, provides the string used in the \fBOrganization:\fR
header of \fBUSENET\fR news postings.  On \fBUNIX\fR, it will override the
contents of an /etc/organization file, if present.
.TP
.B PROTOCOL_proxy
\fILynx\fR supports the use of proxy servers that can act as firewall
gateways and caching servers.  They are preferable to the older gateway
servers (see WWW_access_GATEWAY, below).  Each protocol used by \fILynx\fR,
(http, ftp, gopher, etc), can be mapped separately by setting environment
variables of the form PROTOCOL_proxy (literally: http_proxy, ftp_proxy,
gopher_proxy, etc), to "http://some.server.dom:port/".
See \fBLynx Users Guide\fR for additional details and examples.
.TP
.B SSL_CERT_DIR
Set to the directory containing trusted certificates.
.TP
.B SSL_CERT_FILE
Set to the full path and filename for your file of trusted certificates.
.TP
.B WWW_access_GATEWAY
\fILynx\fR still supports use of gateway servers, with the servers specified
via "WWW_access_GATEWAY" variables (where "access" is lower case and can be
"http", "ftp", "gopher" or "wais"), however most gateway servers have been
discontinued.  Note that you do not include a terminal '/' for gateways, but
do for proxies specified by PROTOCOL_proxy environment variables.
See \fBLynx Users Guide\fR for details.
.TP
.B WWW_HOME
This variable, if set, will override the default startup URL specified
in any of the \fILynx\fR configuration files.
.PP
Environment Variables \fBSet\fR or \fBModified\fR By \fILynx\fR:
.TP 20
.B LYNX_PRINT_DATE
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBDate:\fR
string seen in the document's "\fBInformation about\fR" page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or "No Date" under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBLast Mod:\fR
string seen in the document's "\fBInformation about\fR" page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or "No LastMod" under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_PRINT_TITLE
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBLinkname:\fR
string seen in the document's "\fBInformation about\fR" page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or "No Title" under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_PRINT_URL
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBURL:\fR
string seen in the document's "\fBInformation about\fR" page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or "No URL" under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_TRACE
If set, causes \fILynx\fR to write a trace file as if the \fB-trace\fR
option were supplied.
.TP
.B LYNX_TRACE_FILE
If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace file,
which is either Lynx.trace or LY-TRACE.LOG (the latter on the DOS platform).
The trace file is in either case relative to the home directory.
.TP
.B LYNX_VERSION
This variable is always set by \fILynx\fR, and may be used by an external
program to determine if it was invoked by \fILynx\fR.  See also the comments
in the distribution's sample \fBmailcap\fR file, for notes on usage in such
a file.
.TP
.B TERM
Normally, this variable is used by \fILynx\fR to determine the terminal type
being used to invoke \fILynx\fR.  If, however, it is unset at startup time
(or has the value "unknown"),
or if the \fB-term\fR command-line option is used (see \fBOPTIONS\fR section
above), \fILynx\fR will set or modify its value to the user specified
terminal type (for the \fILynx\fR execution environment).
Note: If set/modified by \fILynx\fR, the values of the \fBLINES\fR and/or
\fBCOLUMNS\fR environment variables may also be changed.
.SH SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT
If built with the \fBcgi-links\fR option enabled, \fILynx\fR allows access
to a cgi script directly without the need for an http daemon.
.PP
When executing such "lynxcgi scripts" (if enabled), the following variables
may be set for simulating a CGI environment:
.PP
.B CONTENT_LENGTH
.PP
.B CONTENT_TYPE
.PP
.B DOCUMENT_ROOT
.PP
.B HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET
.PP
.B HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
.PP
.B HTTP_USER_AGENT
.PP
.B PATH_INFO
.PP
.B PATH_TRANSLATED
.PP
.B QUERY_STRING
.PP
.B REMOTE_ADDR
.PP
.B REMOTE_HOST
.PP
.B REQUEST_METHOD
.PP
.B SERVER_SOFTWARE
.PP
Other environment variables are not inherited by the script, unless they
are provided via a LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT statement in the configuration file.
See the \fBlynx.cfg\fR file, and the (draft) CGI 1.1 Specification
<http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt> for the
definition and usage of these variables.
.PP
The CGI Specification, and other associated documentation, should be consulted
for general information on CGI script programming.
.SH NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT
If configured and installed with \fBNative Language Support\fR, \fILynx\fR
will display status and other messages in your local language.  See the
file \fBABOUT_NLS\fR in the source distribution, or at your local \fBGNU\fR
site, for more information about internationalization.
.PP
The following environment variables may be used to alter default settings:
.TP 20
.B LANG
This variable, if set, will override the default message language.  It
is an \fBISO 639\fR two-letter code identifying the language.  Language
codes are \fBNOT\fR the same as the country codes given in \fBISO 3166\fR.
.TP
.B LANGUAGE
This variable, if set, will override the default message language.
This is a \fBGNU\fR extension that has higher priority for setting
the message catalog than \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_ALL\fR.
.TP
.B LC_ALL
and
.TP
.B LC_MESSAGES
These variables, if set, specify the notion of native language
formatting style.  They are \fBPOSIXly\fR correct.
.TP
.B LINGUAS
This variable, if set prior to configuration, limits the installed
languages to specific values.  It is a space-separated list of two-letter
codes.  Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.
.TP
.B NLSPATH
This variable, if set, is used as the path prefix for message catalogs.

Note that man page availability and section numbering is somewhat
platform dependent, and may vary from the above references.
.PP
A section shown as (GNU), is intended to denote that the topic
may be available via an info page, instead of a man page (i.e., try
"info subject", rather than "man subject").
.PP
A section shown as (?) denotes that documentation on the topic exists,
but is not part of an established documentation retrieval system (see
the distribution files associated with the topic, or contact your
System Administrator for further information).
.SH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way.
The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Computing
Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ
in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of
Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx.
Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of
Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
and the WWW community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who ported
much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development since the
departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the University of Kansas
in the summer of 1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and to everyone
on the net who has contributed to Lynx's development either directly (through
patches, comments or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and
development of other systems).
