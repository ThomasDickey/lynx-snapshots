.PP
Use \*(``lynx \-help\*('' to display a complete list of current options.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.hy 0
.I
Lynx
is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users
running cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices
(e.g., vt100 terminals,
vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT/XP/7/8 or any POSIX platform,
or any other \*(``curses-oriented\*('' display).
It will display hypertext
markup language (HTML) documents containing links to
files residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.
Current versions of
.I
Lynx
run on
Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT/XP/7/8, DOS DJGPP and OS/2.
.PP
.I
Lynx
can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or
to build information systems intended primarily for local access.
For example,
.I
Lynx
has been used to build several Campus Wide
Information Systems (CWIS).
In addition,
.I
Lynx
can be used to
build systems isolated within a single LAN.
.SH OPTIONS
At start up, \fILynx\fR will load any local
file or remote URL specified at the command line.
For help with URLs, press \*(``\fB?\fR\*(''
or \*(``\fBH\fR\*('' while running \fILynx\fR.
Then follow the link titled, \*(``Help on URLs.\*(''
.PP
If more than one local file or remote URL is listed on the command line,
\fILynx\fP will open only the last interactively.
All of the names (local files and remote URLs)
are added to the \fBG)oto\fP history.
.PP
\fILynx\fR uses only long option names.
Option names can begin with double dash \*(``\-\-\*('' as well,
underscores and dashes can be intermixed in
option names (in the reference below, options
are shown
with one dash \*(``\-\*('' before them, and
with underscores \*(``_\*('').
.PP
\fILynx\fR provides many command-line options.
Some options require a value (string, number or keyword).
These are noted in the reference below.
The other options set boolean values in the program.
There are three types of boolean options: set, unset and toggle.
If no option value is given, these have the obvious meaning:
set (to true), unset (to false), or toggle (between true/false).
For any of these, an explicit value can be given in different
forms to allow for operating system constraints,
e.g.,
.NS
\fB\-center:off\fP
\fB\-center=off\fP
\fB\-center\-\fP
.NE
.PP
\fILynx\fR recognizes
\*(``1\*('', \*(``+\*('', \*(``on\*('' and \*(``true\*('' for true values, and
\*(``0\*('', \*(``\-\*('', \*(``off\*('' and \*(``false\*('' for false values.
Other option-values are ignored.
.PP
The default boolean, number and string option values that are compiled
into \fILynx\fP are displayed in the help-message provided by \fBlynx \-help\fP.
Some of those may differ according to how \fILynx\fP was built;
see the help message itself for these values.
The \fB\-help\fP option is processed in the third pass of options-processing,
so any option which sets a value,
as well as runtime configuration values are reflected in the help-message.
.TP 7
.B \-
If the argument is only \*(``\-\*('', then \fILynx\fP expects to receive
the arguments from the standard input.
This is to allow for the
potentially very long command line that can be associated
with the \fB\-get_data\fR or \fB\-post_data\fR arguments (see below).
It can also be used to avoid having sensitive information
in the invoking command line (which would be visible to
other processes on most systems), especially when
the \fB\-auth\fR or \fB\-pauth\fR options are used.
.TP
.B \-accept_all_cookies
accept all cookies.
.TP
.B \-anonymous
apply restrictions for anonymous account, see also \fB\-restrictions\fR.
.TP
.B \-assume_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
charset for documents that do not specify it.
.TP
.B \-assume_local_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
charset assumed for local files,
i.e., files which \fILynx\fP creates such as
internal pages for the options menu.
.TP
.B \-assume_unrec_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
use this instead of unrecognized charsets.
.TP
.B \-auth\fR=\fIID\fR:\fIPASSWD
set authorization ID and password for protected documents at startup.
Be sure to protect any script files which use
this switch.
.TP
.B \-base
prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html
outputs for \fB\-source\fR dumps.
.TP
.B \-bibhost\fR=\fIURL
specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).
.TP
.B \-blink
forces high intensity background colors for color mode, if available
and supported by the terminal.
This applies to the \fBslang\fR library (for a few terminal emulators),
or to OS/2 EMX with \fBncurses\fR.
.TP
.B \-book
use the bookmark page as the startfile.
The default or command
line startfile is still set for the Main screen command, and will
be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
.TP
.B \-buried_news
toggles scanning of news articles for buried references, and
converts them to news links.
Not recommended because email
addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to
false news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.
.TP
.B \-cache\fR=\fINUMBER
set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.
The default is 10.
.TP
.B \-case
enable case-sensitive string searching.
.TP
.B \-center
Toggle center alignment in HTML TABLE.
.TP
.B \-cfg\fR=\fIFILENAME
specifies a \fILynx\fP configuration file other than the default
lynx.cfg.
.TP
.B \-child
exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk and associated
print/mail options.
.TP
.B \-child_relaxed
exit on left-arrow in startfile, but allow save to disk and associated
print/mail options.
.TP
.B \-cmd_log\fR=\fIFILENAME
write keystroke commands and related information to the specified file.
.TP
.B \-cmd_script\fR=\fIFILENAME
read keystroke commands from the specified file.
You can use the data written using the \fB\-cmd_log\fR option.
\fILynx\fP will ignore other information which the command-logging may have
written to the logfile.
Each line of the command script contains either
a comment beginning with \*(``#\*('',
or a keyword:
.RS
.TP 3
.B exit
causes the script to stop, and forces \fILynx\fP to exit immediately.
.TP
.B key
the character value, in printable form.
Cursor and other special keys are given as names, e.g., \*(``Down Arrow\*(''.
Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is,
and hexadecimal values represent other 8-bit codes.
.TP
.B set
followed by a \*(``name=value\*('' allows one to override values set in the
lynx.cfg or \&.lynxrc files.
\fILynx\fP tries the cfg-file setting first.
.RE
.TP
.B \-collapse_br_tags
toggles collapsing of BR tags.
.TP
.B \-color
forces color mode on, if available.
Default color control sequences
which work for many terminal types are assumed if the terminal
capability description does not specify how to handle color.
\fILynx\fP needs to be compiled with the \fBslang\fR library for this flag,
it is equivalent to setting the \fBCOLORTERM\fR environment variable.
(If color support is instead provided by a color-capable curses
library like \fBncurses\fR, \fILynx\fP relies completely on the terminal
description to determine whether color mode is possible, and
this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)
A saved show_color=always setting found in a \&.lynxrc file at
startup has the same effect.
A saved show_color=never found
in \&.lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
.TP
.B \-connect_timeout\fR=\fIN
Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.
.TP
.B \-cookie_file\fR=\fIFILENAME
specifies a file to use to read cookies.
If none is specified, the default value is ~/.lynx_cookies
for most systems, but ~/cookies for MS-DOS.
.TP
.B \-cookie_save_file\fR=\fIFILENAME
specifies a file to use to store cookies.
If none is specified, the value given by
\fB\-cookie_file\fR is used.
.TP
.B \-cookies
toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.
.TP
.B \-core
toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.
Turn this option off to ask \fILynx\fP to force
a core dump if a fatal error occurs.
.TP
.B \-crawl
with \fB\-traversal,\fR output each page to a file.
with \fB\-dump\fR, format output as with \fB\-traversal\fR,
but to the standard output.
.TP
.B \-curses_pads
toggles the use of curses \*(``pad\*('' feature which supports
left/right scrolling of the display.
The feature is normally available for curses configurations,
but inactive.
To activate it, use the \*(``|\*('' character or the LINEWRAP_TOGGLE command.
Toggling this option makes the feature altogether unavailable.
.TP
.B \-debug_partial
separate incremental display stages with MessageSecs delay
.TP
.B \-default_colors
toggles the default-colors feature which is normally set in the lynx.cfg file.
.TP
.B \-delay
add DebugSecs delay after each progress-message
.TP
.B \-display\fR=\fIDISPLAY
set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.
.TP
.B \-display_charset\fR=\fIMIMEname
set the charset for the terminal output.
.TP
.B \-dont_wrap_pre
inhibit wrapping of text when \fB\-dump\fR'ing and \fB\-crawl\fR'ing,
mark wrapped lines of <pre> in interactive session.
.TP
.B \-dump
dumps the formatted output of the default document or those
specified on the command line to standard output.
Unlike interactive mode, all documents are processed.
This can be used in the following way:
.NS
lynx \fB\-dump\fR http://www.subir.com/lynx.html
.NE
.IP
Files specified on the command line are formatted as HTML if
their names end with one of the standard web suffixes such
as \*(``.htm\*('' or \*(``.html\*(''.
Use the \fB\-force_html\fP option to format files whose names do not follow
this convention.
.TP
.B \-editor\fR=\fIEDITOR
enable external editing, using the specified
EDITOR.
(vi, ed, emacs, etc.)
.TP
.B \-emacskeys
enable emacs-like key movement.
.TP
.B \-enable_scrollback
toggles compatibility with communication programs' scrollback keys
(may be incompatible with some curses packages).
.TP
.B \-error_file\fR=\fIFILE
define a file where \fILynx\fP will report HTTP access codes.
.TP
.B \-exec
enable local program execution (normally not configured).
.TP
.B \-fileversions
include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.
.TP

force HREF-less \*(``A\*('' elements to be empty
(close them as soon as they are seen).
.TP
.B \-force_html
forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.
.IP
This is most useful when processing files specified on the command line
which have an unrecognized suffix (or the suffix is associated with a
non-HTML type, such as \*(``.txt\*('' for plain text files).
.IP
\fILynx\fP recognizes these file suffixes as HTML:
.NS
\*(``.ht3\*('',
\*(``.htm\*('',
\*(``.html3\*('',
\*(``.html\*('',
\*(``.htmlx\*('',
\*(``.php3\*('',
\*(``.php\*('',

and are numbered together with other links in the sequence of their
occurrence in the document.
.TP
.B listonly
hidden links are shown only on \fBL)ist\fP screens and listings generated by
.B \-dump
or from the \fBP)rint\fP menu, but appear separately at the end of those lists.
This is the default behavior.
.TP
.B ignore
hidden links do not appear even in listings.

For example \*(``<p/>\*('' will be discarded.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
More than one key can be mapped to a given command.
Here are some of the most useful:
.bP
Use \fBUp arrow\fR and \fBDown arrow\fR to scroll through hypertext links.
.bP
\fBRight arrow\fR or \fBReturn\fR will follow a highlighted hypertext link.
.bP
\fBLeft Arrow\fR or \*(``\fBu\fR\*('' will retreat from a link.
.bP
Type \*(``\fBH\fR\*('', \*(``\fB?\fR\*('', or \fBF1\fR
for online help and descriptions of key-stroke commands.
.bP
Type \*(``\fBk\fR\*('' or \*(``\fBK\fR\*('' for a list of the current key-stroke
command mappings.
.IP
If the same command is mapped to the same letter differing only
by upper/lowercase only the lowercase mapping is shown.
.bP
Type \fBDelete\fR to view history list.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
In addition to various \*(``standard\*('' environment variables such as
\fBHOME\fR, \fBPATH\fR, \fBUSER\fR, \fBDISPLAY\fR, \fBTMPDIR\fR, \fBetc\fR,
\fILynx\fR utilizes several \fILynx\fP-specific environment variables, if they
exist.
.PP
Others may be created or modified by \fILynx\fR to pass data to an external
program, or for other reasons.
These are listed separately below.
.PP
See also the sections on \fBSIMULATED CGI SUPPORT\fR and
\fBNATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\fR, below.
.PP
Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all types of platforms
supported by \fILynx\fR, though most do.
Feedback on platform dependencies is solicited.
.PP
Environment Variables Used By \fILynx\fR:
.TP 20
.B COLORTERM
If set, color capability for the terminal is forced on at startup time.
The actual value assigned to the variable is ignored.
This variable is only meaningful if \fILynx\fR was built using the \fBslang\fR
screen-handling library.
.TP
.B LYNX_CFG
This variable, if set, will override the default location and name of
the global configuration file (normally, \fBlynx.cfg\fR) that was defined
by the LYNX_CFG_FILE constant in the userdefs.h file, during installation.
.IP
See the userdefs.h file for more information.
.TP
.B LYNX_CFG_PATH
If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in search-list of directories
used to find the configuration files, e.g., \fBlynx.cfg\fP and \fBlynx.lss\fP.
The list is delimited with ":" (or ";" for Windows) like the \fBPATH\fP
environment variable.
.TP
.B LYNX_HELPFILE
If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in URL and configuration
file URL for the \fILynx\fP help file.
.TP
.B LYNX_LOCALEDIR
If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in location of the
locale directory which contains native language (NLS) message text.
.TP
.B LYNX_LSS
This variable, if set, specifies the location of the default \fILynx\fR
character style sheet file.
[Currently only meaningful if \fILynx\fR was
built using curses color style support.]
.TP
.B LYNX_SAVE_SPACE
This variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for files
saved to disk that is defined in the \fBlynx.cfg SAVE_SPACE:\fR statement.
.IP
See the \fBlynx.cfg\fR file for more information.
.TP
.B LYNX_TEMP_SPACE
This variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for temporary
files that was defined during installation, as well as any value that may
be assigned to the \fBTMPDIR\fR variable.
.TP
.B MAIL
This variable specifies the default inbox \fILynx\fR will check for new
mail, if such checking is enabled in the \fBlynx.cfg\fR file.
.TP
.B NEWS_ORGANIZATION
This variable, if set, provides the string used in the \fBOrganization:\fR
header of \fBUSENET\fR news postings.
It will override the setting of the
ORGANIZATION environment variable, if it is also set (and, on \fBUNIX\fR,
the contents of an /etc/organization file, if present).
.TP
.B NNTPSERVER
If set, this variable specifies the default NNTP server that will be used
for \fBUSENET\fR news reading and posting with \fILynx\fR, via news: URL's.
.TP
.B ORGANIZATION
This variable, if set, provides the string used in the \fBOrganization:\fR
header of \fBUSENET\fR news postings.
On \fBUNIX\fR, it will override the
contents of an /etc/organization file, if present.
.TP
.I PROTOCOL\fB_proxy\fR
\fILynx\fR supports the use of proxy servers that can act as firewall
gateways and caching servers.
They are preferable to the older gateway
servers (see WWW_access_GATEWAY, below).
.IP
Each protocol used by \fILynx\fR,
(http, ftp, gopher, etc), can be mapped separately by setting environment
variables of the form \fIPROTOCOL\fP_proxy.
Protocols are indicated in a URI by the name before \*(``:\*('', e.g.,
\*(``http\*('' in 
\*(``http://some.server.dom:port/\*('' for HTML. 
.IP
Depending on your system configuration and supported protocols,
the environment variables recognized by \fIlynx\fP may include
.NS
cso_proxy
finger_proxy
ftp_proxy
gopher_proxy
https_proxy
http_proxy
newspost_proxy
newsreply_proxy
news_proxy
nntp_proxy
no_proxy

snewsreply_proxy
snews_proxy
wais_proxy
.NE
.IP
See \fBLynx Users Guide\fR for additional details and examples.
.TP
.B SSL_CERT_DIR
Set to the directory containing trusted certificates.
.TP
.B SSL_CERT_FILE
Set to the full path and filename for your file of trusted certificates.
.TP
.B WWW_\fIaccess\fB_GATEWAY
\fILynx\fR still supports use of gateway servers, with the servers specified
via \*(``WWW_\fIaccess\fP_GATEWAY\*('' variables
(where \*(``\fIaccess\fP\*('' is lower case and can be
\*(``http\*('', \*(``ftp\*('', \*(``gopher\*('' or \*(``wais\*('').
However most gateway servers have been discontinued.
Note that you do not include a terminal \*(``/\*('' for gateways, but
do for proxies specified by \fIPROTOCOL\fP_proxy environment variables.
.IP
See \fBLynx Users Guide\fR for details.
.TP
.B WWW_HOME
This variable, if set, will override the default startup URL specified
in any of the \fILynx\fR configuration files.
.PP
Environment Variables \fBSet\fR or \fBModified\fR By \fILynx\fR:

This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBDate:\fR
string seen in the document's \*(``\fBInformation about\fR\*('' page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or \*(``No Date\*('' under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBLast Mod:\fR
string seen in the document's \*(``\fBInformation about\fR\*('' page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or \*(``No LastMod\*('' under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_PRINT_TITLE
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBLinkname:\fR
string seen in the document's \*(``\fBInformation about\fR\*('' page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or \*(``No Title\*('' under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_PRINT_URL
This variable is set by the \fILynx\fR p(rint) function, to the
\fBURL:\fR
string seen in the document's \*(``\fBInformation about\fR\*('' page (= cmd),
if any.
It is created for use by an external program, as defined in a
\fBlynx.cfg PRINTER:\fR definition statement.
If the field does not exist for the document, the variable is set to a
null string under \fBUNIX\fR, or \*(``No URL\*('' under \fBVMS\fR.
.TP
.B LYNX_TRACE
If set, causes \fILynx\fR to write a trace file as if the \fB\-trace\fR
option were supplied.
.TP
.B LYNX_TRACE_FILE
If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace file,
which is either \fBLynx.trace\fP or \fBLY\-TRACE.LOG\fP
(the latter on the DOS/Windows platforms).
The trace file is in either case relative to the home directory.
.TP
.B LYNX_VERSION
This variable is always set by \fILynx\fR, and may be used by an external
program to determine if it was invoked by \fILynx\fR.
.IP
See also the comments
in the distribution's sample \fBmailcap\fR file, for notes on usage in such
a file.
.TP
.B TERM
Normally, this variable is used by \fILynx\fR to determine the terminal type
being used to invoke \fILynx\fR.
If, however, it is unset at startup time
(or has the value \*(``unknown\*(''),
or if the \fB\-term\fR command-line option is used (see \fBOPTIONS\fR section
above), \fILynx\fR will set or modify its value to the user specified
terminal type (for the \fILynx\fR execution environment).
Note: If set/modified by \fILynx\fR, the values of the \fBLINES\fR and/or
\fBCOLUMNS\fR environment variables may also be changed.
.SH SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT
If built with the \fBcgi-links\fR option enabled, \fILynx\fR allows access
to a cgi script directly without the need for an http daemon.
.PP
When executing such \*(``lynxcgi scripts\*('' (if enabled),
the following variables may be set for simulating a CGI environment:
.PP
.B CONTENT_LENGTH
.PP
.B CONTENT_TYPE
.PP
.B DOCUMENT_ROOT
.PP
.B HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET
.PP
.B HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
.PP
.B HTTP_USER_AGENT
.PP

.PP
.B PATH_TRANSLATED
.PP
.B QUERY_STRING
.PP
.B REMOTE_ADDR
.PP
.B REMOTE_HOST
.PP
.B REQUEST_METHOD
.PP
.B SERVER_SOFTWARE
.PP
Other environment variables are not inherited by the script, unless they
are provided via a LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT statement in the configuration file.
See the \fBlynx.cfg\fR file, and the (draft) CGI 1.1 Specification
<http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt> for the
definition and usage of these variables.
.PP
The CGI Specification, and other associated documentation, should be consulted
for general information on CGI script programming.
.SH NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT
If configured and installed with \fBNative Language Support\fR, \fILynx\fR
will display status and other messages in your local language.
See the
file \fBABOUT_NLS\fR in the source distribution, or at your local \fBGNU\fR
site, for more information about internationalization.
.PP
The following environment variables may be used to alter default settings:
.TP 20
.B LANG
This variable, if set, will override the default message language.
It is an \fBISO 639\fR two-letter code identifying the language.
Language codes are \fBNOT\fR the same
as the country codes given in \fBISO 3166\fR.
.TP
.B LANGUAGE
This variable, if set, will override the default message language.
This is a \fBGNU\fR extension that has higher priority for setting
the message catalog than \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_ALL\fR.
.TP
.B LC_ALL
and
.TP
.B LC_MESSAGES
These variables, if set, specify the notion of native language
formatting style.
They are \fBPOSIXly\fR correct.
.TP
.B LINGUAS
This variable, if set prior to configuration, limits the installed
languages to specific values.
It is a space-separated list of two-letter codes.
Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.

.SH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
\fILynx\fP has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way.
The earliest versions of \fILynx\fP included code from Earl Fogel of Computing
Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ
in the Unix environment.
HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of
Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of \fILynx\fP.
Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of
\fILynx\fP rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
and the WWW community.
Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who ported
much of \fILynx\fP to VMS and did or organized most of its development since the
departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the University of Kansas
in the summer of 1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and to everyone
on the net who has contributed to \fILynx\fP's development either directly
(through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirectly
(through inspiration and development of other systems).
