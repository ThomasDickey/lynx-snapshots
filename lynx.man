.I
Lynx
is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users
running cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g.,
vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any
other "curses-oriented" display).  It will display hypertext
markup language (HTML) documents containing links to
files residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.
Current versions of
.I
Lynx
run on
Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.
.PP
.I
Lynx
can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or
to build information systems intended primarily for local access.
For example,
.I
Lynx
has been used to build several Campus Wide
Information Systems (CWIS).  In addition,
.I
Lynx
can be used to
build systems isolated within a single LAN.
.SH OPTIONS
At start up, \fILynx\fR will load any local 
file or remote URL specified at the command
line.  For help with URLs, press \fB"?"\fR
or \fB"h"\fR while running \fILynx\fR.
Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."
.PP
.TP
.B -
If the argument is only '-', then Lynx expects to receive
the arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the
potentially very long command line that can be associated
with the -get_data or -post_data arguments (see below).
.TP
.B -anonymous
used to specify the anonymous account.
.TP
.B -assume_charset\fR=\fIID\fR:\fIMIMEname
charset for documents that don't specify it.
.TP
.B -assume_local_charset\fR=\fIID\fR:\fIMIMEname
charset assumed for local files.
.TP
.B -assume_unrec_charset\fR=\fIID\fR:\fIMIMEname
use this instead of unrecognized charsets.
.TP
.B -auth\fR=\fIID\fR:\fIPASSWD
set authorization ID and password for protected documents
at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files which use
this switch.
.TP
.B -base
prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html
outputs for -source dumps.
.TP
.B -blink
forces high intensity bg colors for color mode, if available
and supported by the terminal.
Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.
.TP
.B -book
use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
line startfile is still set for the Main screen command, and will
be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
.TP
.B -buried_news
toggles scanning of news articles for buried references, and
converts them to news links.  Not recommended because email
addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to
false news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.
.TP
.B -cache\fR=\fINUMBER
set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.
The default is 10.
.TP
.B -case

lynx.cfg.
.TP
.B -child

.TP
.B -color
forces color mode on, if available.  Default color control sequences
which work for many terminal types are assumed if the terminal
capability description does not specify how to handle color.
Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.
A saved show_color=always setting found in a .lynxrc file at
startup has the same effect.  A saved show_color=always found
in .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
.TP
.B -cookies
toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.
.TP
.B -core
toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.

EDITOR. (vi, ed, emacs, etc.)

.SH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way.
The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Computing
Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ
in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of 
Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx.
Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of 
Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
and the WWW community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who ported
much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development since the
departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the University of Kansas
in the summer of 1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and to everyone
on the net who has contributed to Lynx's development either directly (through
patches, comments or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and
development of other systems).
