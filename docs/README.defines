[ If README.configure goes away, "(see README.configure)" has to change ]

A place to list preprocessor macros (symbols) which are tested in the
code (typically with ifdef).

Does not include
- symbols defined and documented in userdefs.h
- symbols expected to be set by compiler to indicate system type or
  compiler features
- some symbols set and used only in connection with the ./configure
  mechanism - the full and current list can be found in config.hin
  (as a template) or, after running ./configure, in lynx_cfg.h.
- symbols and macros defined in the source code

***Not complete.***

A. Symbols primarily to enable compilation on specific systems
==============================================================
See also under B for things needed by some systems.

# if you have an SVR4 system with the "type any key" problem, try defining
#
# -DSVR4_BSDSELECT

# Old Data General systems may need this in their SITE_LYDEFS
# for their inet_addr(host) calls.
#
# -DDGUX_OLD

---
Ports have been added for Win32 (95/NT) and 386 DOS computers with a
packet driver.  I created four new defines to accomplish this.
	_WINDOWS Defined for Win32 specific code (Mostly TCP related)
	DJGPP    Defined for 386 specific code (Mostly TCP related)
	DOSPATH  Defined for any DOS'ish computer
	NOSIGHUP Defined for computers not supporting sighup signal calls.

Added for 8+3 filesystems (DOS):
	FNAMES_8_3  also defined in userdefs.h if __DJGPP__

B. Symbols to enable or disable specific features, mostly
=========================================================
Note that some of these may be only usable on some system types,
most were originally for UNIX.

Network related, specific protocols
-----------------------------------
# -DSOCKS          For making a SOCKSified lynx.
       			see comments in makefile.in
# -DSHORTENED_RBIND  For a SOCKSified lynx with the short version of Rbind.
               		see comments in makefile.in
# -DNOPORT         if you must use PASV instead of PORT for FTP

Related to DirEd code - probably one usable for UNIX or similar
---------------------------------------------------------------
# -DDIRED_SUPPORT  (see README.configure)
# -DOK_GZIP        (see README.configure)
# -DOK_OVERRIDE    (see README.configure)
# -DOK_PERMIT      (see README.configure)
# -DOK_TAR         (see README.configure)
# -DOK_UUDECODE    (see README.configure)
# -DOK_ZIP         (see README.configure)
# -DARCHIVE_ONLY   (see README.configure)
# -DNO_CHANGE_EXECUTE_PERMS (see README.configure)

Related to formatting of local directory listings
-------------------------------------------------
# -DLONG_LIST      (see README.configure)
# -DNO_PARENT_DIR_REFERENCE (see README.configure)

Related to screen display
-------------------------
Using curses or ncurses library:
# -DNCURSES        (see README.configure)
# -DFANCY_CURSES   whether curses lib supports more than very basic stuff
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure, for VMS defined in code
# -DNO_KEYPAD (old) or HAVE_KEYPAD (new)   whether curses lib uses keypad().
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure, may be set in HTUtils.h
# -DCOLOR_CURSES    whether curses lib supports color (in the right way).
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure
# -DUNDERLINE_LINKS  Define if you want links underlined instead of bold.
# -DHP_TERMINAL    For DIM workaround to REVERSE problems on HP terminals.
# -DNO_SIZECHANGE (old) or HAVE_SIZECHANGE (new) whether using code to detect
                   new size after size changes of the terminal (window).
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure, may be set in HTUtils.h
# -DNO_SIZECHANGEHACK  disable hack for size increase handling.

Using slang library:
# -DUSE_SLANG      (see README.configure)
# -DSLANG_MBCS_HACK prevent cutoff lines when using UTF8 console (slang only)
Both:
# -DREVERSE_CLEAR_SCREEN_PROBLEM
# 	if you have the reverse clear screen problem of some SUN4 systems, or
# 	to work around some other "garbage on the screen" problems

Related to *experimental* (unsupported) character style code
------------------------------------------------------------
# -DUSE_COLOR_STYLE (see README.configure) probably needs -DNCURSES
# -DUSE_HASH       (see README.configure)  probably needs the above
# -DLINKEDSTYLES   (see README.configure)  probably needs the above

Other
-----
# -DDONT_TRACK_INTERNAL_LINKS - Handle following links to same doc differently.
# -DEXP_CHARTRANS  (see README.configure - currently needed, WILL GO AWAY)
# -DEXP_CHARTRANS_AUTOSWITCH also let lynx switch term mode(Linux console only)
# -DIGNORE_CTRL_C  Define if Control-C shouldn't exit lynx.
# -DLY_FIND_LEAKS  (see README.configure)
# -DNO_CPU_LIMIT   Disables Max CPU timeout (includes CLOCKS_PER_SECOND)
# -DNSL_FORK       For fork-based name server lookups that can be 'z'apped.
# -DSYSLOG_REQUESTED_URLS
# 	if you would like logging of client requests via syslog()
# -DUSE_ZLIB       To use some functions from zlib library if you have it.
# -DDECLARE_WAIS_LOGFILES   see comments in makefile.in
