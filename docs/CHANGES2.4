--- Rename of Lynx2-3-FM and release as Lynx2-4  (08-June-1995) ---
==============================================================================
06-08-95
* All of the changes from lynx2-3-FM are now located at ftp2.cc.ukans.edu.
  We will call this version lynx2-4 and all new changes will be added here.
  - JP
06-05-95
* Added isc support based on post to lynx-dev from Ami Fischman
  (a540ami@pic.ucla.edu). - FM
06-04-95
* Initialize t1->name before the StrAllocCopy() in LYMainLoop.c for
  DIRED_SUPPORT tagging. - Rick Mallett (rmallett@ccs.carleton.ca)
* Don't bother creating a /tmp copy of local files for downloading
  under the DIRED_SUPPORT, and don't include "Save to disk" in the
  download menu for such files. - RM
* Deal with any newlines or tabs in statusline messages, along lines
  in patch from Peter Marquardt. - FM
* Various fixes to ensure terminations of strings, along lines suggested
  by PM. - FM
* Made HTAlert messages more readable in trace mode.
* Replaced info.cern.ch with www.w3.org in userdefs.h and lynx.cfg. - GL
* Allow definition of the global configuration file (lynx.cfg) path and
  name via a "LYNX_CFG" VMS logical or Unix environment variable.  Will
  override the "LYNX_CFG_FILE" definition in userdefs.h.  The -cfg command
  line switch will override those.  SYS$LOGIN (VMS) or '~' (Unix) can be
  used in the path to treat the global configuration file as a personal
  configuration file ($HOME will be substituted for '~'). Meets objective
  in patch posted by Danny Meyer (mayer@ljsrv2.enet.dec.com) but does
  not seek lynx.cfg in the user's HOME directory without an explicit
  directive to do so.  Issue a screen message and then exit if the
  configuration file is not readeable (rather than continuing as if
  one had been found and read). - FM
* Added protections from NAMEless INPUT or TEXTAREA tags. - FM
05-29-95
* Changed close(*s) typo in HTTCP.c to NETCLOSE(*s).  Caused tight loops if
  on error *s became stdin. - Peter_Marquardt (wwwutz@cha01.tfh-berlin.de)
05-20-95
* Mods of proxying/gatewaying code, replace obsolete info.cern.ch default
  URL addresses with www.w3.org, and add option to use the new www.w3.org
  wais search gateway in cover page for wais searches. - FM
05-10-95
* If a startfile specified on the command line maps to a MIME type
  which invokes an alternate display device, allow -homepage, if also
  specified, to be substituted for startfile on quiting from the display
  device, rather than forcing an exit due to the original startfile having
  been neither text/html nor text/plain.  Based on a patch from GL, with
  protections against possible infinite getfile() loops added. - FM
* Include -t switch when pico is the editor for reply_by_mail() in
  LYMail.c. - GL
05-04-95
* Oops.  Had zipped the wrong LYReadCFG.c in yesterday's mods. - FM
05-03-95
* Do not override any external proxy and no_proxy variables with those
  in lynx.cfg.  Bug fixes in code for setting proxy variables on Unix,
  based on patches from Roman Czyborra (czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de). - FM
* Fixes for tagging when Lynx jumps to another screen and then comes back,
  and deal with possibility of screen outputs from compress/decompress
  utilities. - GL
* Added support for Sequent's DYNIX/ptx operating system, and bug fixes
  in HTTCP.c's BSDselect(). - Rodney Barnett (RBarnett@us.teltech.com)
* Increased limits in select() loops to 5000 tries. - FM
* Specify /nomember for compilations with DECC.  It's not the default
  on AXP and the code assumes byte alignment. - FM
04-19-95
* Added Alan Hirsh's script (LynxDir:VMSPrint.com) for dealing with busy
  VMS print queues such that Lynx might otherwise delete the temporary
  file before it has been queued for printing. - FM
* Added lots of type casting to the mathematical operations in GridText.c
  to minimize possible sizing/alignment problems for DECC/AXP (and any
  Unix flavors that use the Alpha chip). - FM
04-17-95
* Use  test=test -z "$LYNX_VERSION"  like  test=test -n "$LYNX_VERSION"
  in mailcap files simply as flags for non-LYNX versus LYNX environment,
  without actually bothering to execute a test. - FM
* Issue "** Bad HTML!!!  Use -trace to diagnose. **" statusline messages
  when bad HTML is encountered, and suppress those statusline messages in
  favor of the TRACE messages when -trace is used. - FM
* Fixed anchor deletion problem in yesterday's ISMAP mods. - FM
* Removed -ltermcap from AIX makes (AIX doesn't use it). - FM
04-16-95
* Send a 0,0 coordinate pair if a user clicks on an ISMAP link, so that
  it's handled equivalently to clicks on an ISMAP submit button, and
  (typically) will return the server's default.  Note that the default
  often is the parent document, and if so, the current document will
  be returned via redirection (pointlessly 8-).  However, this mod
  allows the WebMaster to use a pure-text document as the default for
  Lynx. - FM
* Protections against crashes for inappropriately positioned form tags. - FM
* Fixes in handling of configurable INEWS path. - FM
* Support for VT500 series terminals. - George Cook (cook@wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu)
04-12-95
* Makefile tweaks for bsdi and aix4. - FM
04-11-95
* Mods for building with BSD Interative (bsdi). - FM
04-08-95
* Added translation of HTML entities and decimal escaping for the
  VALUEs of INPUT and OPTION tags. - FM
* For TYPE="image" INPUT tags, use "[IMAGE]-Submit" as a pseudo-ALT
  string, and submit a 0,0 coordinate pair if it's clicked, which
  typically will invoke the server's default (I guess something is
  better than nothing. 8-). - FM
* Handle (possibly multiple) angle brackets in bookmark and showinfo
  link names. - FM
* Fixed typo in for-ultrix code in LYMain.c. - FM
04-04-95
* Added ability to set proxy environment variables via lynx.cfg. - FM
04-01-95
* Added handling of the HTML 3.0 attributes for ISINDEX tags:
      ISINDEX HREF="reference" PROMPT="string"
  The ACTION attribute didn't make it into HTML 2.0.  For now, we'll keep
  supporting it in Lynx by treating it as a synonym for HREF. - FM
03-31-95
* Mods for AIX v4.1.1 and addition of make aix4. - FM
* Added prototype and extern declarations for BSDselect(). - FM
* Fixed bugs in form_getstr() that could clobber the stack. - GL
* Fixes for symlink handling. - GL
* Made LYShowInfo.c aware of the setuid, setgid and sticky file modes,
  and nicer mode display if the file doesn't have the read bit set. - GL
03-30-95
* Fixed glitch in BASE tag handling. - FM
03-29-95
* Initialize pointers in add_trusted() of LYGetFile.c before the
  StrAllocCopy() calls. - FM
03-26-95
* Miscellaneous TRACE and related messaging tweaks. - FM
03-24-95
* Handle defaulted localhost in file BASE tags, and related tweaks of
  defaulted localhost handling in file URLs. - FM
* Use RM_PATH for both file and directory deletions with the DIRED_SUPPORT
  remove function. - GL
--- STARTING  2.3-FM ---
==============================================================================
03-23-95
* Designate this code set as lynx2-3-FM to avoid any confusion with the
  official releases at UKans. - FM
* Tweaks of code for defaulted localhost in file URLs.  Don't require
  any host field marker in such URLs - FM
03-21-95
* Added handling of defaulted localhost in file URLs. - FM
* More protections against bad HTML. - FM
* SYSLOGing enhancements. - GL
* Suspend curses during my_spawn()'s, and fixes of code for the child
  and error return detection. - GL
03-20-95
* More protections against potentially infinite loops. - FM
03-16-95
* Enhancements of 'c'omment and mailto handling. - FM
* Mods to build.com for enabling submission to BATCH. - FM
* Ultrix terminal-handling fix. - Roman Czyborra (czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de)
03-15-95
* Fixed bug in for-Unix directory listing code to screen out inaccessible
  parent directories.  Was also being applied to ftp listings. - FM
* Made bolding of H1 through H7 headers a lynx.cfg option, with the
  non-bolding as the compilation default. - FM
03-13-95
* Fixed bug in setting link[].lname elements to empty strings for form
  INPUT_ANCHORs.  Was causing showinfo() to report the links from the
  previous document (yet another memory leak bites the dust 8-). - FM
* Numerous fixups of bold and underline handling. - FM
03-09-95
* Increased the while() loop limit for select() tries in HTTCP.c to 500. - FM
* Memory allocation/free fixes in HTAccess.c. - FM
* Makefile and documentation tweaks. - FM
03-07-95
* Implemented HT_BOLD when specified for headers in DefaultStyle.c.  H1 is
  now uppercase, bold, and centered.  H2 - H7 are lower or mixed case, bold,
  and progressively indented. - FM
* Miscellaneous enhancements of menu displays. - FM
* Allow tabs and '$' in lynxexec commands. - FM
* More TOUPPER/TOLOWER fixes. - FM
03-06-95
* Added ability to set the INEWS path in lynx.cfg. - FM
03-05-95
* Separated the newspost URL into newspost versus newsreply, and modified
  LYNews.c to behave more rationally for new versus followup posting. - FM
* Added "mode reader" command for news list and article requests. - FM
* Enabled saving of list_dir_style settings in the user's RC file. - FM
* Don't restrict rearming SIGINT in LYClean.c for IGNORE_CTRL_C to just
  SVR4. - FM
* Added numerous protections against core_dumps/ACCVIOs in HTML.c for bad
  HTML.  Should also help reduce likelihood of infinite while() loops and
  a runaway CPU if binary files are mistyped and rendering is attempted. - FM
* Added (unsigned char) type casts in addch() calls for proper handling of
  high value ISOLATIN1 characters. - FM
* Limited the while() loop for select()'s in HTTCP.c to 50 tries, to help
  reduce likelyhood of a runaway CPU on undetected terminal disconnects. - FM
* Fixed typo in build.com. - FM
* Added Craig's lynx_help and about_lynx files for the lynx2-3-7 distribution,
  updated for lynx2-3-9 BETA. - FM
--- STARTING  2.3.9 BETA ---
==============================================================================
02-20-95
* Updated doc files and passed on to UKans for archiving on the
  ftp2.cc.ukans.edu server as 2.3.8 BETA. - FM
02-17-95
* Further updates of building procedures for VMS. - FM
* Further updates of lynx.man, lynx.hlp and documentation.  Indicate
  that the inside_foo and outside_foo restrictions are not selective
  on systems which lack utmp. - FM
* Changed yesterday's DGUX define fo DGUX_OLD, because only older
  Data General systems need it. - FM
02-16-95
* Added Jeff's updates of lynx.man and lynx.hlp, further updated for
  v2.3.8 - FM
* Fixed typos in LYMail.c and HTTPC.c. - FM
* Cleaned up #ifdef'ing for -DIGNORE_CTRL_C. - FM
* Added -DDGUX for using inet_addr(host).s_addr instead of inet_addr(host)
  in HTParseInet() of HTTCP.c (Data General may need it). - FM
* Don't report "-help" as an invalid option. - FM
02-15-95
* Handle HTML entities and decimal escaping in ALT strings. - FM
* Build fixups for TCPWARE. - FM
02-14-95
* Added transmission of Accept-Language headers.  A default preferred
  language is defined in userdefs.h.  It can be overridden via lynx.cfg.
  Users can change that via the 'o'ptions menu and save their preference
  in their RC file. - FM
* Tweak of FIXED record handling on VMS. - FM
* Defined Unix ZIP_PATH and UNZIP_PATH in userdefs.h. - FM
02-12-95
* Added  -localhost  switch for restricting access to files and servers
  on the local host. - FM
* Added  -nobrowse   switch for disabling directory browsing. - FM
* Added  -selective  switch for requiring a .www_browsable file in
  each directory for browsing access to it.  The enabling files
  are not included in the directory listings. - FM
* Fixed up displaying of README files in directory listings on
  VMS. - FM
* Replaced all tolower() and toupper() calls with the TOUPPER() and
  TOLOWER() macros in HTUtils.h (should help deal with some of the
  strange behavior reported for some flavors of Unix; see header of
  HTUtils.h). - FM
Worked in mods from David Trueman (david@cs.dal.ca) - FM:
* Don't issue the ../ link in Unix local directory listings if the parent
  directory is not readable (was already dealt with on VMS - FM).
* Include an Organization: header in Unix news postings, if possible
  (was already dealt with on VMS - FM).
* Don't allow the editing of Unix mail headers because that is error
  prone (no change on VMS; editable pseudo-headers are included for
  informational purposes, but the real headers are those of the
  account running Lynx - FM).
* Don't hardcode the Unix mv command; use MV_PATH define in userdefs.h.
* Moved the Unix COPY_COMAND define to userdefs.h as COPY_PATH.
* Completed the Unix ZIP support.
02-10-95
* Added code for converting the headers of downloaded binaries on VMS
  to indicate FIXED 512 record format.  See the documentation in
  userdefs.h, lynx.cfg and FIXED512.COM for more information. - FM
02-08-95
* Fixed glitch in HTInit.c which mis-casted the default MIME type for
  files with a .sh extension, causing the EXEC_SCRIPT function to be
  disfunctional. - FM
* I think I finally have Lynx showing "(p# of N)" properly in the title
  lines (we'll see if perfection has really been achieved 8-). - FM
* Extended directory browsing on VMS to the -homepage specification,
  if included on the command line, e.g., lynx -homepage=sys$login
  will start up Lynx with the default startfile, but the 'm'ain menu
  command will yield listings of the home directory. - FM
* Added -fileversions switch on VMS for including all versions of files
  in directory browser listings (otherwise, only the highest version is
  listed, with no version numbers displayed). - FM
* Modified LYEdit.c to use fopen(filename,"a") instead of access(filename,2)
  to verify write access for editing files (checking "append" access appears
  to be a more reliable way to do it across platforms/flavors). - FM
02-07-95
* Implemented directory browsing for VMS. - FM
* Fixed printer command handling to actually prompt for and use a second
  filename argument if two "%s" strings are in the command map. - FM
* Added anti-Unix-shell-spoofing code for all of the filename argument
  handling. - FM
* Fixed glitch in getenv(DISPLAY) calls on VMS.
02-04-95
* Fixed a glitch in BASE support.  Should now work properly when both
  standard and Lynx-specific hrefs are in the document. - FM
02-03-95
* Added support for posting to newsgroups from Lynx on VMS via the
  ANU-NEWS software. - FM
* Numerous href parsing enhancements. - FM
* Enhancements and bug fixes of news displays. - FM
* Enabled display of Linknames with angle brackets (as for news URLs)
  in the showinfo page. - FM
* Ensured that a file URL which is really an ftp URL will yield an
  "FTP is Disabled" statusline message when it's disabled. - FM
02-01-95
* Defined out the LYK_VERSION code and made Control-V a dead key again,
  since including the Lynx name and version strings in the showinfo ('=')
  and 'o'ptions displays is adequate, and people on different platforms
  or flavors associate Control-V with other functions. - FM
01-31-95
* Beefed up the BASE support. - FM
* Made all WWWLib cover pages and menus HTTP/1.0 compliant (to ensure
  resetting of any BASE tags) and gave them more pizzaz. - FM
* Trim terminal slashes in ftp paths if not the Welcome directory, so
  we'll get "Up to" links.  Terminal slashes in file paths still force
  that directory to be treated as the Welcome directory.  For example,
   ftp://host/blah/foo/ will have an "Up to blah" link listed, but
  file://host/blah/foo/ will treat /blah/foo/ as "Welcome" (both ftp
  and file "Up to" links are blocked by -DNO_PARENT_DIR_REFERENCE). - FM
* The VMS SOCKETSHR_TCP support can't yet handle telnet, tn3270 or
  rlogin URL's (Andy Harper is working on it; be patient 8-).  Modified
  HTTelnet.c to compile properly and behave rationally when such URL's
  aren't supported. - FM
* Corrected doc files based on Larry Virden's (lvirden@cas.org) careful
  (or is it carefull) proof-reading.  Thanks Larry! - FM
* More type casts for ANSI C compliance. - FM
01-30-95
* Added numerous type casts for ANSI C compliance. - FM
01-29-95
* Prototyped HTHostName() for yesterday's mods in HTAccess.c. - FM
* Updated lynx.cfg. - FM
01-28-95
* Added lynx name and version to the showinfo page and options menu. - FM
* Tweaked Danny's news proxying mods for selective no_proxy directives
  with a port field (119) for news, and added equivalent code for wais
  (port 210). - FM
* Updated the INSTALLATION file (I hope people read it 8-). - FM
* Hadn't included last night's typo fix in the archived fileset. - FM
01-27-95
* Added Danny Mayer's (mayer@ljo.dec.com) mods for proper handling of
  no_proxy directives for news (NNTPSERVER) hosts. - FM
* Worked in Ari Luotonen's (luotonen@dxcern.cern.ch) mods for sending
  a "Pragma: no-cache" header for use by a proxy server in conjunction
  with the RELOAD command. - FM
* Fixed to handle file URL's appropriately in conjunction with proxying
  of ftp URL's.  For file URL's on the local host, direct access is
  attempted, with no ftp attempt if that fails, whether or not proxying
  is in effect, and whether or not no_proxy directives have been set.
  Both ftp URL's, and file URL's on a remote host, are sought via ftp
  without a direct access attempt.  File URL's for remote hosts are
  converted to ftp URL's before submission to a proxy server, so no
  special procedure need be implemented to induce the proxy server to
  act on them (You shouldn't continue using file URL's when you intend
  ftp, but Lynx will handle such URL's properly when encountered in
  old documents that use file when ftp is intended.) - FM
* Fixed typo in yesterday's "psychotherapy". - FM
01-26-95
* Escaping of ISINDEX queries needed more tweaks to work properly with
  high value IsoLatin1 characters. - FM
* Applied psychotherapy to the schizophrenic behavior that was exhibited
  when download, upload, print, history or showinfo commands were used
  during displays of each other's menus or temporary files. - FM
* Enabled downloading of links from the history page. - FM
01-25-95
* Added LYK_VERSION command (^V) for showing version of Lynx. - FM
* Include file fixes for TCPWARE. - FM
* Fixed bug in showinfo() which caused core dumps when invoked while
  positioned on any form field which has a "linkname" but a NULL
  "filename". - FM
* Fixed glitch in 'p'rint menu. - FM
01-24-95
* Enabled SOCKSification for any Unix flavor via the SITE-LYDEFS,
  SITE-DEFS and SOCKSLIB definitions in the top-level Makefile.  Added
  info in INSTALLATION on how to do it for VMS.  Included notes that you
  are better off building Lynx normally, and instead using a SOCKSified
  proxy server to get through a firewall. - FM
* Added instructions in INSTALLATION for setting up proxy service. - FM
* Fixed multiple submit button handling to distiguish which button was
  activated when they have the same name, and include only that button's
  name/value pair in the submission. - FM
* Figured out how to apply all security and restrictions checks for
  redirecting URLs returned by ISINDEX searches, and accordingly lifted
  the bypasses for the previously insecure access types. - FM
* Added option to use Jerry Whelan's (guru@bradley.edu) BSDselect() for
  SVR4 systems with the "type any key" problem. - FM
01-23-95
* Fixed up escaping of queries in HTSearch(). - FM
* Updated the sample jumps files. - FM
* Worked in socksification mods from Reese Ferry (reesef@VNET.IBM.COM) - FM
* Enabled use of LOCALE for international characters with any Unix flavor
  (not just sun) via a define in the top level Makefile. - FM
01-22-95
* Updated the lynx.cfg configuration file. - FM
* Implemented BASE handling. - FM
01-21-95
* Fixed -cfg switch handling so that the specified, alternate configuration
  file properly is read instead of the default system file specified in
  userdefs.h. - FM
* Made 'p'rint, 'd'ownload and 'u'pload menu lists single spaced. - FM
* Fixed HTFileFormat() in HTFile.c so that it properly processes the
  suffix-to-MIME-type mappings when version numbers are in local file
  URLs on VMS.  We therefore no longer trim off the version number if
  if was included, and Lynx will now access and process that version
  rather than only the highest version. - FM
01-18-95
* Makefile fixes for convex and linux. - FM
01-17-95
* More Makefile fixes. - FM
01-14-95
* Fixes for FreeBSD. - FM
01-12-95
* Made the "ls -l" emulation in local directory listings a compilation
  option (see the top level Makefile). - FM
* Made inclusion of "Up to" parent links in local directory listings a
  compilation option (see top level Makefile). - FM
* Message fix for checkmail on Unix. - FM
* Fixes for SCO with gcc. - FM
01-11-95
* Restored original hash table function in HTAnchor.c without (hopefully 8-)
  reviving anchor deletion problems. - FM
* Fixed typo in HTAccess.c. - FM
* Added code in HTFile.c from Timothy Newsham (newsham@aloha.net) for
  generating long style Unix listings (ls -l). - FM
01-10-95
* Escape dashes in lynx.man. - FM
* Added NetBSD support from Bryan T. Vold (btv@wiley.HealthPartners.COM). - FM
* Made anchor searches in hash tables case-sensitive (so paths which
  differ only in their case can be distinguished, as people using the
  DIRED support kept requesting) without (hopefully 8-) reviving anchor
  deletion problems. - FM
01-09-95
* More Makefile and code fixes for building properly with various systems
  and compilers. - FM
01-06-95
* Numerous fixes for handling signals (e.g., SIGWINCH) received during
  keystroke fetches, without (hopefully 8-) reviving the problem of
  runaway CPU's on undetected terminal disconnects. - FM
* More Makefile and code fixes for building properly with various systems
  and compilers. - FM
01-05-95
* Changed define for syslog() logging to SYSLOG_REQUESTED_URLS and picked up
  logging of ISINDEX search requests that don't go through getfile(). - FM
* More fixes for redirection returned via ISINDEX searches. - FM
* Fixed missing newline character at end of last .lynxrc entry. - FM
* More Makefile tweaks. - FM
* More additions in LYCurses.h for compilers which fail to check whether TRUE
  and FALSE are already defined before defining them in curses.h. - FM
01-03-95
* Fix for redirection returned via ISINDEX searches. - FM
12-29-94
* Yet more top level Makefile tweaks. - FM
* Fix bcopy problem for UCX. - Martin Zinser (zinser@vscn.gsi.de)
* Fix ioctl() problem for UCX. - MZ
12-27-94
* More top level Makefile tweaks. - FM
12-26-94
* Added Lou Montulli's procedure for PURIFY to the top level Makefile. - FM
12-23-94
* Added Lou Montulli's memory leak fixes. - FM
* Fixed HTLoadedDocumentTitle() call in LYGetFile.c. - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.8 BETA ---
12-22-94
* The WFEB code as of 12-15-94 has been archived at UKans as lynx2-3-7,
  so we'll make this lynx2-3-8 to avoid confusion. - FM
* Added bookmark_exec restriction for disallowing use of lynxexec URL's
  in the user's bookmark file or converted Mosaic hotlist. - FM
* Enable any lynxexec URL in JUMPFILE if EXEC_LINKS has been defined.
  This allows you to set both LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ON_BUT_NOT_REMOTE
  to TRUE and a single TRUSTED_EXEC rule that will always fail (e.g.,
  TRUSTED_EXEC:none), so that *ONLY* the lynxexec URL's in the jumps
  file will be acted upon. - FM
* Disallow lynxexec URL's in G)oto if no_shell is set or if
  LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ON_BUT_NOT_REMOTE is TRUE. - FM
12-21-94
* Include LYFLAGS in the BSDI_Makefile. - FM
* Numerous mods based on patches from David Trueman - FM:
* Changed SUN4 ifdef for implementing the "reverse clear screen hack" to
  REVERSE_CLEAR_SCREEN_PROBLEM since not all sun4 systems experience this
  problem.
* Changed a few messages to use key_for_func() instead of a hard-coded
  key mapping.
* Allow control-C as well as control-G to abort or cancel on Unix (as
  already on VMS).  On VMS, control-C and control-Y evoke a "Do you really
  want to quit?" prompt, and a 'n'o reply gets handled as if control-G
  has been entered in the first place.  On Unix, control-C is treated
  simply as a synonym for control-G, and control-Y is not an interrupt
  signal.  This seems the best way to handle those control signals, based
  on what VMSers versus Unixites would expect them to do.
* Added code to disallow the writing of files beginning with a dot if
  NO_DOT_FILES is set TRUE in userdefs.h and/or lynx.cfg.
* Added possibility of logging URL access via syslog() on Unix (ifdef'd
  with LOGGING).
* Improved and made more flexible the security for lynxexec URL's.  The
  default behaviour is the same as now, but source locations and the path
  (Unix) or name (VMS) of programs to be executed can be restricted via
  TRUSTED_EXEC rules in the lynx.cfg file.
* Convert ~ in lynxexec paths to $HOME on Unix.
* Several changes in DIRED support.  Tidied and consolidated code.  Changed
  the way tags are freed (fixing a bug where they did not always get cleared
  properly).  Changed all programs to *_PATH defines.  Changed the display
  of tags so they work with numbered links.
* Added another restriction to disallow telnet port specifications in
  G)oto URL's.
* A bit of special case code in jump handling.  If key mapping is G, allow it
  to be typed as "go target".
* Change strncmp in remap() to strcmp() (bug fix).
* Report offending bad option in main().
* In mainloop(), make \r same as \t and \n.
* Combine LYK_REMOVE code with LYK_DEL_BOOKMARK so that they can share the
  same key map.
* If show_cursor is true, position cursor 1 position before the link, which
  makes it less likely that the link is obscured in defective terminal
  programs
12-15-94
* More fixes in LYno_attr_char_case_strstr() and LYno_attr_char_strstr() - FM
* People didn't like having to erase the default WHEREIS ('/') search string
  when it wasn't what they wanted in a new document (though most didn't know
  that it can be done easily via ^U), and Lynx doesn't have real editing via
  LYgetstr() (just deletion from the end of the string), so I got rid of the
  the editing offer.  The previous search string is still buffered across
  document fetches, and can be used across documents via NEXT ('n').  You
  also can use WHEREIS without a search string entry to turn off highlighting
  within the current document, and then NEXT to restore it.  If control-G is
  used instead of a blank string to cancel a WHEREIS command, it does not
  turn off the highlighting.  So everything everyone asked for is now
  possible (once you figure out how to do it 8-). - FM
12-14-94
* Oops!  Fixes in tcp.h for MULTINET with DECC/VAX had left SOCKET_ERRNO
  undefined for all the other VMS TCPIP packages.  That's what I get for
  working on this stuff too late at night. - FM
* Additional ANSI compliance fixes in HTTCP.c for builds with DECC/VAX and
  non-MULTINET VMS TCPIP packages. - FM
12-13-94
* Modified searches for strings within the currently displayed document
  ('/', as opposed to 's' for ISINDEX searches) so that the highlighting of
  the search string is not retained when the current document is changed,
  and added recall buffering of the search string so that it's offered as
  the default for editing or reuse on subsequent '/' commands.  Also, we
  now force redraws on invokations of such searches so that hits will be
  highlighted even if they occur on the current page.  Links with hits such
  that they have embedded highlighting of the search strings will not have
  the embedded highlighting restored when the cursor is moved onto and then
  off of them (helps to distinguished whether it's intended or the due to
  the search), but will be restored whenever the page is redrawn.  All
  embedded highlighting also is restored when the 'n'ext command is used to
  repeat the search in the current document, even if the returned hits do not
  cause a page change.  Note that these searches first search only the links,
  and position you on the first link with a hit occurring after the current
  link.  If there were no hits in the links, then the text is searched and
  the first hit occurring after the current link is positioned at the top of
  the page.  They never did, and still do not, search both the link and text
  portions of the document simultaneously.  Also note that ISINDEX searches
  never have and still do not yield highlighting of the query string(s) in
  the returned document.
* Fixed LYno_attr_char_case_strstr() and LYno_attr_char_strstr() in
  HTStrings.c so that they properly ignore any attribute characters in
  the comparison string and return a pointer to the correct location
  of a match with the target string. - FM
12-12-94
* Modified FTP gateway to display 230- as well as 250- information/help
  messages, and on non-Unix as well as Unix systems. - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.7 BETA ---
12-11-94
* Further tweaked explanatory comments in the configuration and samples
  files, and updated the instruction files. - FM
12-09-94
* Modifed PassesTest() in HTInit.c to avoid the overhead of system() calls
  by using getenv() when   test -n "$DISPLAY"   and   test -z "$DISPLAY"
  commands are encountered in the mailcap file.  Otherwise, needlessly
  expensive system() calls potentially could be made for virtually every
  viewer mapping in that file!.  For Lynx, those two strings in the mailcap
  file now are equivalent to the :XWINDOWS and :NON_XWINDOWS flags,
  respectively, for VIEWER: assignments in lynx.cfg. - FM
* Also modified PassesTest() so that it simply treats  test -n "LYNX_VERSION"
  as success.  Why spawn a system() command to see if Lynx is running, when
  it obviously is!.  However, that string can be included in the mailcap
  file for assignments that should be restricted to Lynx if other software
  also uses the file. - FM
* The above two mods make it unnecessary to actually use a "test" script for
  differentially setting viewers in XWINDOWS versus NON_XWINDOWS environments,
  so VMSers also can use the mailcap files for differential assigments of
  viewers, without those DCL error messages about "test" which have been
  mystifying so many people.  However, yesterday's mods do make it possible
  for VMSers to use a "test" script for checking other environment or system
  features, and thereby setting viewer switches differentially, analogously
  to the command line switches for Lynx itself. - FM
* Modified comments in samples/mailcap to indicate these enhancements. - FM
* Modified comments in userdefs.h to describe correctly what the Lynx code
  does as of v2.3:  Any SUFFIX or VIEWER mappings in lynx.cfg will be
  overridden in src/HTInit.c if they also appear there.  Then, any mappings
  in mime.type or mailcap will override those from lynx.cfg and src/HTInit.c.
  The XLOADIMAGE definition is used in src/HTIinit.c, and you can use
  mailcap, but not lynx.cfg, to override it. - FM
* Modified comments in lynx.cfg and samples/lynx.cfg to indicate what Lynx
  really does, and the use of mailcap files to do what lynx.cfg had claimed
  it could do but doesn't. - FM
* Fully implemented multiple submit button support for both POST and GET
  forms. - FM
* Added LYK_RESUBMIT keymap (with default binding to 'x' and 'X') for forcing
  submissions of forms to servers (i.e., never use cache).  LYK_ACTIVATE
  (with default binding to right-arrow and RETURN) still fetches from cache
  if available.  Statusline help describes these commands when positioned
  on a submit button. - FM
12-08-94
* Fixed HText_submitForm() in GridText.c to handle submitting INPUT types
  (e.g., type="image") which have name/value pairs. - FM
* Modified DCLspawn to recognize -1 on failure and 0 or 1 on success as
  return or exit values of scripts, and report -1 or 0 as it's own return
  value.  If a "test" script is used on VMS in conjunction with .mailcap
  for setting viewers, it should return -1 if the test fails and 0 or 1 if
  it passes (the "test" script can be DCL or an exectutable, and should be
  defined as a foreign command).  If you don't have a "test" script, don't
  include that instruction in .mailcap. - FM
* The tmpaddress pointer in do_www_search() of GridText.c needed to be
  initalized to NULL. - FM
12-07-94
* Made sufficiently ANSI compliant to build with DECC on VMS without using
  the /stand=vaxc qualifier, and further modified so that Lynx will build
  and run (extremely well 8-) with DECC/VAX.  Whooh, that took some doing!
  These mods are also desireable for builds on Unix. - FM
12-02-94
* Fixed the query recall buffer in do_www_search() of GridText.c to restore
  the +'s to spaces and unescape properly. - FM
* Include file and define fix ups, for SOCKETSHR/NETLIB support and convex
  builds, in tcp.h, LYShowInfo.c and top level Makefile. - FM
11-27-94
* Fixed bugs associated with failure to check the post_data element in
  addition to the address element when making push/pop decisions for the
  history stack, and when checking whether a requested document has been
  loaded successfully.  The address element is insufficient for documents
  returned by POST'ed forms. - FM
* Check -trace switch earlier in LYMain.c so that trace messages associated
  with setting up the Lynx configuration will actually be displayed. - GL
11-23-94
* More fix ups for the SOCKETSHR/NETLIB support.  Close to "all set" but needs
  more field testing with the full range of TCPIP packages for VMS. - FM
* Added HP_TERMINAL define for the DIM workaround to the REVERSE problem with
  HP terminals.  If not defined, SNAKE builds will not make that substitution
  (would be better to do this in a way that checks the terminal at run time,
  but we'll hold off on that for now). - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.6 BETA ---
11-21-94
* Replaced ucx$inetdef.h with socketshr_library:ioctl.h for the
  SOCKETSHR_TCP builds.  Note that the ioctl.h is not presently included
  in the binary distribution of SOCKETSHR/NETLIB.  You have to get it from
  the sources distribution. - FM
11-18-94
* Added Andy Harper's (A.Harper@bay.cc.kcl.ac.uk) "first round" support for
  SOCKETSHR/NETLIB (see SOCKETSHR.ANNOUNCE).  Note that it is presently
  including ucx$inetdef.h which is not provided with SOCKETSHR or NETLIB
  source sets, and may not be available to non-UCX sites.  We're checking
  into how to deal with that. - FM
* Made recall buffering of shortcuts for the 'J'ump command a configuration
  file option (in userdefs.h and/or lynx.cfg). - FM
* Added clearerr() before the GetChar() in LYStrings.c. - FM
* Made the optional novice help lines conform to the "standard default"
  key bindings.  Edit them appropriately in userdefs.h if you plan to use
  other bindings with that feature.
* Added George Lindholm's (lindholm@ucs.ubc.ca) Makefile patch for making it
  just a tad easier to set up local compile options. - FM
* Eliminated serial free() in LYSanctify() of LYGetFile.c. - FM
* Restricted all "hack to fix reverse clear screen problem" code to
  SUN4 (had missed one 8-). - FM
11-15-94
* Eliminated separate list and atexit deletions of redirecting anchors. - FM
* Added Rick Dyson's (Dyson@IowaSP.Physics.UIowa.EDU) updates of the
  descrip.mms files. - FM
11-12-94
* Worked in Malcolm MacArthur's (mcscs2mm@zippy.dct.ac.uk) mods for reading
  a printer's page length from the configuration file and calculating the
  correct number of pages for the statusline query on whether to continue
  if the document is longer than 4 printer pages.  Further modified that
  code to use the current LYlines for the computation when the built in
  "print to screen" option is selected.  See the comments concerning
  "PRINTER:" definitions in lynx.cfg for more information. - FM
* Fixed HTInetStatus() in HTTCP.c to use SOCKET_ERRNO instead of errno,
  based on the platform/transport-specific definitions in tcp.h.  Thanks
  to Danny Mayer (mayer@ljo.dec.com) for tracking down this glitch. - FM
11-10-94
* Added David Trueman's latest clever enhancement:  The command line option
  -homepage=URL separates the notion of a home page (or main screen) from
  the start file.  So,  lynx -homepage=URL1 URL2  will start up with URL2
  but the MAIN_MENU key will take the user to URL1 rather than URL2.  This
  is useful for public accounts that start up with an information page or
  form, that then leads the user to a URL for the actual home page.  The
  MAIN_MENU key can thereafter be used whenever the user wishes to return
  to the actual home page. - FM
* Enlarged string buffer in LYEdit.c to handle large paths. - FM
* Made 'K'eymap title and descriptions easier to edit for alternate languages
  (e.g., Dutch or Greek) as required by Dick Wesseling (but, alas, the editing
  still has to be done in LYKeymap.c, because it's too much to move into
  userdefs.h; someday Lynx will have real internationalization code 8-) - FM
* Added titles to tops of jumps files so that the nesting level will be reset
  on reloads. - FM
11-09-94
* More prototyping and include file fixes in LYJump.c and LYMainLoop.c - FM
11-08-94
* Prototyping fix in LYJump.c. - FM
* Miscellaneous fixes in src/descrip.mms. - FM
* Hadn't included patch for latest LYUtils.c in lynx2-3-5.patches. - FM
11-07-94
* At popular request (already 8-), changed the "Jump to:" query to work
  exactly like the "goto:" query.  The previous entry is recalled, a '?'
  must be entered explicitly to fetch the shortcut list (with an instruction
  about that added to the prompt), and a blank entry or Control-G returns
  the user to the current document. - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.5 BETA ---
11-05-94
* Numerous wonderful enhancements based on patches from David Trueman, and
  entensions of those mods.  Briefly:
* Implemented 'K'eymap command for showing all of the key bindings currently
  in effect, with a description of their functions.  This is faster and
  more helpful than the online help's description of the default key
  bindings.  Must be uppercase 'K' if VI keys are ON, otherwise the command
  is case-insensitive.  Try it, you'll love it! - FM
* Implemented 'J'ump command for using "shortcut" names to access URL's in a
  local "jumps.html" file that has a sorted DL list which maps each target
  (shortcut) DT to it's full URL DD (see the sample jumps files added to
  the distribution).  The URL's could be local or remote resources, or
  lynxexec or launch file URL's for system utilities (e.g., the shortcut
  "news" could invoke the news reader, "mail" the mail utility, "swing" the
  VMS File/Directory Management Utility, etc.).  This feature is enabled by
  defining JUMPFILE in userdefs.h or lynx.cfg, and can be disabled via at
  run time via -restrictions=jump as a commandline switch.  Must be uppercase
  'J' if VI keys are ON, otherwise the command is case-insensitive.  Try it,
  you'll love this too! - FM
* Added a CHECKMAIL symbol which if set TRUE in userdefs.h or lynx.cfg will
  report the existance of unread mail at Lynx startup, and arrivals of new
  mail, via statusline messages.  VMSers can block unsoliticed system NEWMAIL
  screen broadcasts ($ SET BROADCAST/NOMAIL) when using this feature.  It
  can be disabled at run time via the -restrictions=mail switch, which also
  disables standard mail functions in Lynx, but still allows 'J'umps via a
  "mail" shortcut to a lynxexec URL for a script which could perform security
  functions before permitting or rejecting access to the mail utility.  The
  hackers will really love this! - FM
* Added ability to toggle the novice help line to show all of the principle
  commands. - FM
* Miscellanous bugs and memory leaks found and fixed in conjuction with
  adding and enhancing the above features. - FM
* The code may need some tweaking to build and run properly on some flavors
  of Unix (appears to be all set for VMS). - FM
11-01-94
* Fixed bug if editor is dereferenced. - David Trueman (david@cs.dal.ca)
* Enable alternate boxing of popup windows via defines for BOXVERT and
  BOXHORI in userdefs.h - Dick Wesseling (ftu@fi.ruu.nl)
* Check for LYCursesON before making any Curses calls in cleanup() - DW
10-31-94
* Looks like the last of the problems deleting anchors has been solved
  by Dick Wasseling, so the bypass is lifted again. - FM
* If CANT_EDIT_UNWRITABLE_FILES is defined on Unix, write access is
  required to edit files (write and delete access are always required
  on VMS). - Alex Whittaker (alex@biu.icnet.uk)
* Moved "Press  RETURN ..." text to userdefs.h. - AW
10-28-94
* Uncache documents or bookmark file before reloads (via Control-R or
  'r'emove command) in LYMainLoop.c. - FM
* Uncache showinfo display or print, download, option, etc, menus before
  reloading those in GridText.c. - Dick Wesseling (ftu@fi.ruu.nl)
* Above two fixes still don't completely solve the anchor deletion problem,
  so we're still bypassing.
* Enable iso entity translations inside TITLEs - DW
10-26-94
* Problems when deleting anchors have been reported, apparently for
  documents which have been (re)loaded with LYforce_no_cache.  So,
  we'll retore the bypass until that problem is tracked down. - FM
10-25-94
* Added coded for disabling mail for -anonymous via CAN_ANONYMOUS_MAIL in
  userdefs.h, and via -restrictions=mail (default is enabled). - FM
10-21-94
* Added Danny Mayer's (mayer@ljo.dec.com) samples/lynx.com - FM
10-05-94
* Modified tcp.h to deal with conflicting typedefing in the MultiNet
  types.h and time.h versus those for DECC. - FM
* Define FANCY_CURSES for linux-ncurses. - FM
09-30-94
* -restrictions help list in LYMain.c should indicate "option_save" (not
  "options_save") for disabling the saving of options in .lynxrc. - FM
09-29-94
Mods based on patches from George Lindholm (lindholm@ucs.ubc.ca) - FM:
* Fixed problem when IGNORE_CTRL_C is defined, that was created by the
  fix for runaway processes on Unix when undetected terminal disconnects
  occurred.
* Added options to disable rlogin and/or ftp access.
09-28-94
* Use "hack to fix reverse clear screen problem" in GridText.c if SUN4 is
  defined (still need clarification on the exact nature of the problem
  to decide if this is the best way to handle it; it bothers me to have
  this kind of hack in the code 8-) - FM
Mods based on patches from George Lindholm (lindholm@ucs.ubc.ca) - FM:
* Move the "quit" text to userdefs.h from LYMainLoop.c for easier
  customization.
* Typo fix for buttons submit value in GridText.c
* Renable SIGINT signal for SVR4 machines if control-c is to be ignored
  when editing.
* Solaris fixes for LYCurses.h.
* Recognize pico as a special editor.
* Fix -restrictions help text.
* Fix -telnet and -news options so that they actually do something.
* Fix upload code so that you can have more than one uploader option,
  and fix for freeing a static variable.
* Various prototype fixes.
* -editor command line option signals that the editor can't be changed.
* Added a SYSTEM_EDITOR option to lynx.cfg for a locked editor.
--- RELEASE of 2.3.4 BETA ---
09-27-94
* Alas!  I think I've tracked down and fixed all the bugs that were causing
  ACCVIOs/CoreDumps if anchors were deleted/freed when freeing the cached
  documents.  So now we do delete/free them.  This plugs a major memory
  leak in Lynx (which we knew about, but heretofore had to live with). - FM
* Added Danny Mayer's (mayer@ljo.dec.com) fix so that MIME types are handled
  case-insensitively. - FM
* Restored text/html (WWW_HTML) as the default MIME type when an HTTP/1.0
  server fails to send it in the headers.  This happens because it's the
  default in Mosaic and developers using that don't realize their server or
  script code is failing to send it (other MIME types will be caught as an
  error, and the code will be fixed by the developers).  Garrett's change to
  application/octet-stream (WWW_UNKNOWN) was technically correct.  You can
  change it back to that where indicated in HTMIME.c if you prefer that Lynx
  be technically correct but functionally wrong when dealing with this
  situation. - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.3 BETA ---
09-22-94
* Finished up redirection handling.  Will now handle serial redirections
  across multiple sites (with an arbitrary limit of 10, to prevent the
  possibilily of an infinite loop of circular redirections), works properly
  with redirections via the VALUE fields of OPTION tags, and no longer alters
  any anchor addresses, avoiding all the problems that caused in the hash
  table. - FM
* Worked in Rick Mallett's (rmallett@ccs.carleton.ca) fix for runaway
  processes on Unix when undetected terminal disconnects occur. - FM
* Added Eric Jon Rostetter's (ERIC@uoft02.utoledo.edu) code for proper
  keyboard handling with DEC eightbit terminals. - FM
* Added David Greer's (david_greer@robelle.com) mods for curses on
  HP terminals. - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.2 BETA ---
09-17-94
* More fix ups of forms structure handling, freeing and redirecting. - FM
* Fixed problem with free's of startfile, thanks to Dick Wesseling
  ftu@fi.ruu.nl - FM
09-14-94
* More memory leak and redirection fix ups (still not perfect). - FM
* Various mods to speed up memory management with VAXC on VAXen (still
  slow compared to DECC on AXPen). - FM
09-13-94
* If an ISINDEX document is one returned by a previous search, the 's'
  command puts up the query which returned it, for editting as a new query
  (use Control-U to erase, Control-G to abort)  Otherwise, no string is
  offered in the prompt for a database query.  If the previous query is
  submitted without modification, a message to use Control-R to resubmit
  the same query is display (so that the search will not be repeated
  inadvertantly). - FM
09-12-94
* Fixed failure to load the popped menu properly when a gopher search was
  selected and a NULL string, Control-G, or arrow key is entered to cancel
  the prompt for a query. - FM
* Hit lists/documents returned by ISINDEX searches are now always displayed
  at their tops.  They no longer inherit, inappropriately, the page and link
  numbers of the previous list/document. - FM
09-11-94
* Fixed redirection handling so that the hash tables are updated and the
  history stack works properly, including with forms that have VALUE
  fields in OPTION tags that return Location: URL's for searches (e.g.,
  the CUSI forms at Nexor).  Whew, that took some doing! - FM
09-05-94
* Fixed up remaining problems with OPTION VALUE="foo" handling and the
  associated popup window positioning and scrolling. - FM
* Fixed bugs and several inadequacies in the history structure and code
  (still needs some redesigning to deal more effectively with all aspects
  of documents returned by forms and/or redirection). - FM
* Now deals properly with anchors in a single document returned by
  a form. - FM
* Command line file specs on VMS can now be any valid explicit, wildcarded,
  partial, or relative VMS specification, and will be converted to a valid
  file://localhost/ URL, so that partial or relative URL's within the file
  also will be interpretted properly. - FM
* Now trims trailing white space and won't get tripped up by '=' characters
  when reading configuration files. - FM
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements. - FM
* Tracked down and eliminated more memory leaks. - FM
--- RELEASE of 2.3.1 BETA ---
7-08-94
* Correction handling of OPTION VALUE="" implemented.
* Miscellaneous bugs corrected.
6-17-94
* Option to log memory leaks at exit by defining LY_FIND_LEAKS at compilation.
6-17-94
* Check amount of allocated memory, rather than just number of documents
  cached, before deciding to remove the oldest document (implemented for
  VMS with VAXC, not yet for Unix or VMS with DECC).
6-16-94
* VMS bookmark file version numbers are reset on additions of bookmarks.
6-16-94
* Gopher URL's with /hGET%20/ are converted to http URL's, as in the UMN
  Unix/VMS gopher+ client.
6-16-94
* Added DIRECT_WAIS support for VMS
6-16-94
* Added build support for VMS TCPWare TCP/IP
5-28-94
* Increased nesting of HTML elements from 40 to 400.  Hopefully this will limit
  won't be encountered often.
5-28-94
* Modified for handling of Telnet URLs with spaces/other characters in the
  username.
5-26-94
* Began terminating memory leaks with extreme predjudice.
5-24-94
* WAIS searches will now work when they are of type "www/present" as opposed
  to only viewing the source.
5-23-94
* Added VMS CMU TCP/IP support, thanks to Andy Harper.
