  release date is 09-02-96.
* Tweaks of numeric character reference handling. - FM
* Typo fix in LYShowInfo.c. - IC
08-28-96
* Added handling of ENCTYPE="application/sgml-form-urlencoded" in FORMs
  as a directive to use semi-colons instead of ampersands as name=value
  separators, and to indicate that as the Content-Type for POSTs. - FM
* Convert ampersands in addresses and link names, and angle-brackets in
  link names, to SGML entities when creating bookmarks and showinfo ('=')
  link 'l'ist, client-side-image-map, and history list text/html streams
  or temporary files. - FM
* More SGML compliance mods for the handling of attribute values which
  represent URLs or URL components. - FM
* Tweaks of form INPUT, TEXTAREA, SELECT and OPTION handling. - FM
* Check EAGAIN on socket connect or select attempts for all platforms and
  flavors. - FM
* Include both <time.h> and <sys/time.h> in tcp.h for AIX.
* Adding warning and info in the INSTALLATION file and userdefs.h on how
  to cope with telnetd environment variable spamming for anonymous accounts
  running Lynx captively. - FM
08-24-96
* Enhancements of the History List handling.  Show each link's actual address
  in addition to the titles, since the actual addresses can't be determined
  via showinfo or the 'l'ist display, and links in the History List derived
  from searches can have the same titles but different searchparts or hidden
  content appended.  If a link in the History List is activated, is still
  cached, has POST content, and ALWAYS_RESUBMIT_POSTS was configured off (as
  recommended) and wasn't toggled on via -resubmit_posts, prompt the user
  whether to resubmit the form (versus retrieve the cached rendition from
  the previous submission).  We don't bother prompting on PREV_DOC ("back")
  fetches, and still resubmit forms with POST content whenever their submit
  buttons are activated, i.e., regardless of whether ALWAYS_RESUBMIT_POSTS
  has been configured or toggled on. - FM 
* If a user attempts to add a bookmark while viewing a document returned
  via a form submission with POST content, and it contains links, offer
  the current link with it's link name for editing.  Otherwise, display
  a statusline message that documents from forms with POST content cannot
  be saved as bookmarks. - FM
08-23-96
* Added UP_HALF and DOWN_HALF commands, mapped by default to '(' and ')',
  for going back or forward half a page in the document.  These are
  complementary to UP_TWO and DOWN_TWO, for going back or forward two
  lines (remember to use the 'K'eymap command for a list of all of the
  keystroke command bindings currently in effect, since they may have
  been changed via lynx.cfg from the defaults described in the online
  'H'elp). - FM
* Made the Control-A and Control-E keys default synonyms for HOME and END,
  complementary to their use for going to the beginning or end of the line
  when using the line editor. - FM
* Don't lose track of source versus present mode on returns from temporary
  menu files to documents derived from forms with method POST. - FM
* Ugh, I had deleted one too many lines from HTTP.c when stripping out my
  SSL hooks for the distribution copy (no wonder the Authorization mods
  worked fine for me but nobody else 8-). - FM
08-22-96
* Added handling of named entities and numeric character references in
  the values of most of the non-URL attributes (we don't waste overhead
  doing that for the values of simple attributes, like ALIGN, which have
  designated strings). - FM
08-21-96
* Safely handle named entities and numeric character references in the values
  of BASE, LINK, HREF, SRC, ACTION, DATA, CODEBASE and CODE attributes, and
  in the URL field for the CONTENT of META with a "Refresh" HTTP-EQUIV or
  NAME.  They are converted in relation to the "ISO Latin 1" Character Set
  array regardless of the selected Character Set (except that nbsp and shy
  remain 160 and 173), then 8-bit translations are hex escaped (as they
  should have been in the markup 8-), and ESC is hex escaped or omitted
  depending on whether a CJK character set has been selected.  There's no
  way to do it such that the resolved URL always will be valid no matter
  what yoyos or CGI scripts put in document instances, but this strategy
  maximizes the chances while making sure no "dangerous" characters, based
  on the selected Character Set, are ever sent to the screen (it used to be
  HyperText Markup Language, not HyperGraphic Markup Language 8-)- FM
* Allow Control-G or a zero-length username or password to act as a cancel
  of the request (and restoration of the current document) when an http
  server invokes prompting for Authorization. - FM
* When using a proxy server, report the target host instead of the proxy
  in prompts for Authorization. - FM 
* Show MIME types of files, if known, whenever a download offer is forced,
  regardless of why it was forced (i.e, not only for mismatches between
  the document's charset and the selected character set). - FM
08-20-96
* Yet more tweaks of MIME header parsing. - FM
08-19-96
* Enhancements of the news gateway. - FM
* Tweaks of Content-Type and charset handling. - FM
* Tweaks of MIME header parsing. - FM
08-18-96
* Tweaks of the news gateway and its documentation. - FM
08-17-96
* Added overt (rational 8-) handling of all status codes that might be
  returned (appropriately or inappropriately 8-) from HTTP/1.1 http
  servers, and massively annotated the code in HTTP.c. - FM
* Added parsing in HTMIME.c, and at least trace mode reporting, for all
  http server reply and entity headers as in the 08-12-96 HTTP/1.1 draft.
  We should not get many of them, unless we declare ourselves as an HTTP/1.1
  client and send the appropriate request headers, but they're all available
  now for use as more HTTP/1.1 features are added. - FM
08-16-96
* Added handling of "Pragma: no-cache" or "Cache-Control: no-cache" headers
  from http servers, and polished up the code for handling them via META
  directives. - FM
08-15-96
* Modified form handling so that Lynx always resubmits forms if their method
  is POST, even if their content was not changed, when their submit buttons
  or submitting text input are activated.  Changed the ALWAYS_RESUBMIT_FORMS
  compilation and configuration definitions, and -resubmit_forms command
  line toggle, to ALWAYS_RESUBMIT_POSTS, and -resubmit_posts.  When FALSE,
  you still get the previously returned document from a POSTed form if that
  document had links which you activated, and then go back with the PREV_DOC
  command or via the history list.  If set TRUE, the form will be resubmitted
  under those circumstances as well.  Documents returned by forms with method
  GET still require use of the RESUBMIT command to resubmit if the forms'
  content was not changed, and forms with a mailto action still always mail
  the content on activation of the submit button or submitting text input
  (no document is returned, so the PREV_DOC command and history list behaviors
  are irrelevant). - FM
* Use space to plus conversions for values of submitted form content (Ugh,
  Lynx has been using %20 all these years!  It worked because they are
  unescaped to space, anyway. 8-). - FM
* Polished up and massively annotated the redirection handling code.  If
  a user approves redirection of a form with POST content, it will not be
  freed and the submission will not be converted to a contentless GET request
  unless the status was 303 (See Other).  For 300 (Multiple Choices), the
  returned document is offered, which should include links with descriptions
  of their media types.  The returned document (if any) is now displayed for
  any redirection status code if no Location: header was present, and for
  unknown 3xx codes (i.e., greater than 305).  If Lynx gets an inappropriate
  304 (Not Modified), it switches to HEAD mode and displays the status line,
  and anything else returned by the server, as text/plain.  A 301 (Moved
  Permanently) will be treated as 302 (Moved Temporarily) for form submissions
  with POST content.  Otherwise, Lynx will use the new URL for the remainder
  of the current session (users will have to do a 'r'emove and 'a'dd for their
  bookmarks themselves, for now).  A 305 (Use Proxy) will not be honored if
  Lynx is already using a proxy, and instead the returned document will be
  displayed.  The limit on serial redirections was dropped from the current
  10 to 5, as recommended in the August 10, 1996 HTTP/1.1 draft. - FM
08-13-96
* Mods to accommodate the HTTP/1.1 300 - 305 Redirection status codes, and
  to require user confirmation for any redirection of POST content. - FM
* Tweaks of OBJECT handling. - FM
08-12-96
* Implemented all aspects of OBJECT that make sense for a text client.
  Will descend though nested OBJECTs.  Can be used for presenting PRE
  formatted character-cell versions of images, and appears to handle
  all likely uses of the SHAPES and USEMAP attributes in OBJECTs.  The
  pseudo-ALTs for links to non-script DATA values (i.e, the for-GUI
  sources) when offered as links (e.g., in clickable_images mode), if
  not a markup-specified string (e.g., based on a TITLE attribute),
  are (IMAGE) or (OBJECT), based on whether the nature of the source
  can be inferred from the context, or an explicit TYPE attribute in
  the OBJECT start tag.  The use of parens instead of square-brackets
  indicates that the links are for OBJECTs as opposed to IMGs. - FM
* Tweaks of SELECT and OPTION handling. - FM
08-09-96
* Lots more stuff added to the online help files. - FM
* Added state code in SGML.c to avoid getting tripped up by any single or
  double quotes in CJK escape sequences that are within single or double
  quoted attribute values. - TA
* Restrict resetting the Kanji code flag on white space to Japanese
  (i.e., not also Chinese, Taipai, or Korean). - TA
* Added handling of EPLF lines (with local time) for the FTP gateway. -
  D. J. Bernstein (djb@koobera.math.uic.edu)
08-08-96
* Added code for handling captured OBJECT content with the SHAPES
  attribute equivalently to our handling of FIG, and with USEMAP and/or
  ISMAP content equivalently to our handling of IMG.
* Added code for capturing potentially nested container elements that
  require pre-processing, e.g., OBJECT, and for passing the processed
  markup back to the SGML parser to be inserted within the ongoing HTML
  stream.
* Added CHECK_EAGAIN Makefile definition for non-SVR4 Unix flavors which
  might need it for socket connect() and select() calls. - FM
* Tweaks of keyboard input with slang when LYCursesON is FALSE. - FM
08-06-96
* Terminate and start a new Accept: header line if the current one will
  exceed 1 KB (shouldn't be necessary, but otherwise the long lines cause
  an error for WebSitePro and crash Netscape servers, and perhaps have
  adversed effects on some other http servers with ill designed code for
  content negotiation). - FM
* Give temporary files suffixes matched to the Content-Type for all flavors
  of Unix and for VMS, not just for NeXT. - FM 
* Tweak of Location: header parsing in HTTP.c (trim all lead spaces). - FM
08-05-96
* More help and documentation updates. - FM
08-04-96
* Updated the online help files. - FM
08-03-96
* Mods of "user (A)gent" 'o'ption handling.  Also added a "useragent"
  -restriction, included in the defaults for anonymous accounts.  See
  the "Lynx options menu" section of the "Lynx Users Guide" via the
  online 'h'elp for more information. - FM
* Tweaks of messaging for unsupported URLs. - FM
* Tweaks of interrupt handling on VMS. - FM
08-02-96
* Added handling of Refresh in META tags.  The URL is presented as a link
  pointed to by a "REFRESH(n sec):" label, where "n" is the seconds
  parameter from the META tag, and you must activate it yourself, which
  should enable people using Lynx via a braille interface to examine
  the initial document before it is refreshed.  The META format is:
  <META HTTP-EQUIV=refresh CONTENT="n; URL=url"> where "n" can be "0" or
  a positive integer, and the "; URL=url" field is optional, defaulting
  to the document's own address.  Netscape's docs say that "url" should
  be a complete URL, but their client doesn't require it, and so it's
  users don't reliably use complete URLs.  Lynx therefore resolves "url"
  versus the document's own address if it is not complete. - FM
08-01-96
* Added handling of ENCTYPE="text/plain" for FORMs with a mailto ACTION.
  The name=value pairs are not hex escaped, and physical newlines instead
  of '&' separate the pairs, so that the content is readable directly. - FM
* Added SUBJECT attribute as synonym for TITLE in FORMs (Some clients
  are using it instead of TITLE for mailto ACTIONs, ugh!). - FM
* Tweaks of DEL, S, STRIKE, and INS handling. - FM
* Handle any newline characters in quoted INPUT values. - FM
* Added news-ncurses and news-slang Makefile targets, and tweaks of headers
  for sony_news. - Makoto MATSUSHITA (matusita@ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp)
07-30-96
* Finished and incorporated lynx_url_support.html in the online help,
  and updated lynx_help_main.html. - FM
* Tweaks of ID attribute handling. - FM
* Tweaks of the gopher gateway. - FM
* Updated IBMPC-charsets.announce. - MB
07-26-96
* Set the default anonymous account restrictions if Lynx is invoked in
  the account pointed to by ANONYMOUS_USER, or with the -anonymous switch,
  before processing any additional command line restrictions, so that any
  greater restrictions will not drop back to the compilation defaults.
  Note that the full set of -validate restrictions always are enforced for
  that switch, i.e., no matter what other switches or compilation options
  are used, and whether or not the account is anonymous. - FM
* Implemented handling of the ANONYMOUS_USER definition on VMS (equivalently
  to it's implementation on Unix). - FM
* Tweaks of mailto URL handling and setting of the default subject via
  TITLE attributes. - FM
* Tweak of the news gateway's handling of the author (From:) field. - FM 
07-25-96
* If a server returns redirection without a complete URL indicated, resolve
  it relative to the original request instead of issuing an error message
  (this is incorrect behavior, but that's another trashed standard, and
  Lynx may as well handle the situation as standard-less clients do). - FM
* Move the NO_JUMPFILE and JUMP_PROMPT definitions to LYMessages_en.h - FM
* Added code for selective disabling of goto by scheme in anonymous accounts,
  along lines of patch from Doug Lawson (dlawson@epfl2.epflbalto.org). - FM
* Ignore any viewer mappings for text/html or text/plain in mailcap
  files. - FM
07-22-96
* Updated ptx target and added ptx-slang. - Alan Coopersmith
  (alanc@CSUA.Berkeley.EDU)
* Added all the new elements and attributes from the July 12 HTML 3.2/Cougar
  DTD, and implemented the new IMG TITLE attribute for use with USEMAP.
* Added a -startfile_ok switch for allowing a non-http startfile or homepage
  with -validate, and restored the behavior of not allowing *any* non-http
  URLs by default.
07-19-96
* Treat PLAIN and TYPE="plain" as equivalent in UL tags. - FM
* Fixed the mispositioning of thinsp in HTMLDTD.c. - FM
07-18-96
* Moved the statusline prompt, message, and warning string definitions
  out of userdefs.h into an LYMessages_en.h header.  See the comments
  in userdefs.h and LYMessages_en.h for more information. - FM
* Removed the -lc from the LIBS= list of the snake3 and snake3-slang
  targets, added a description of the HP/UX 10.10 select() problems
  and reported (but not yet satisfactory) workarounds in the PROBLEMS
  file, and a note in the Makefile to read the PROBLEMS file. - FM
07-17-96
* Numerous typecasts added for optimized compilations. - FM
* Tweaks for ISC. - WS
* Changed make to $(MAKE) and -g to -O for Unix targets (may need
  tweaking for some flavors 8-). - FM
* Added news target for SONY NEWS-OS 4.2.1R based on patch from
  Kazuya 'Sharl' Masuda (masuda@sp.hudson.co.jp) and TA. - FM
* Fixed typo in LYList.c from yesterday's mods. - FM
07-16-96
* Plugged memory leaks associated with temporary file names. - FM
* Finally figured out what was creating orphan child anchors, and plugged
  that memory leak in HTAnchor_delete(). - FM
* Replace <sys/select.h> with <sys/timeb.h> for SCO in tcp.h. - BL
* Mods to avoid warning about redefinition of signal when building on
  VMS with old versions of SOCKETSHR (irrelevant, but might worry
  people who don't know that the warning can be ignored). - FM
07-15-96
* Plugged various memory leaks in FORM handling code. - FM
07-13-96
* Add the startfile, and homepage if different, to the 'g'oto recall
  buffer so that they are available for editing in addition to any
  overtly entered 'g'oto URLs. - FM
* Changed TRUSTED_URL to ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC for clarity, and plugged
  memory leaks and some security holes in that code. - FM
* Fixed typo in code for handling Z compressed files. - FM
07-12-96
* Added handling of &thinsp; (&#8201;), and handling of &#8194; as &ensp;,
  &#8195; as &emsp;, &#8211; as &ndash; or &endash;, &#8212; as &mdash; or
  &emdash;, and &#8482; as &trade; (treated as &reg; &#174;), based on the
  Cougar DTD. - FM
* Increased the line buffer size in HTLoadHTTP() and limited the deflt string
  length in HTPrompt() to avoid possibilities of buffer overruns. - FM
07-11-96
* Block access to file: URLs via network served files or bookmarks in
  addition to 'g'oto entries when -restrictions=file_url is set (one of
  the default restrictions for -anonymous). - FM
* Extended compressed file handling to the ftp gateway and local files.
  If you ACTIVATE the link instead of overtly invoking a 'd'ownload, and
  the path with the gz or Z stripped maps to a displayable Content-Type or
  one for which you have a viewer or helper app, the file will be treated
  as if it had a Content-Encoding: header indicating the compression (i.e.,
  uncompressed and displayed or passed to the viewer or helper app). - FM
* Mods to send http servers an Accept-Encoding: header indicating gzip and
  compress, and to block inclusion of our new, internal www/compressed MIME
  type in the Accept: header list. - FM
* Changed the names of the lex_buffer and lex_lines globals to HTlex_buffer
  and HTlex_lines in case name conflicts are causing segmentation faults on
  linux for long usernames in authorization requests, and changed all
  malloc()'s to calloc()'s in that code in case there's an initialization
  glitch I don't yet see. - FM
07-09-96
* Use the username and password of an -auth= command line argument only
  for the first realm that requests authorization, so they don't preclude
  access to other realms later in any interactive session that might have
  a different username and/or password, and handle inclusion of only a
  username or only a password in the -auth= argument. - FM
* Tweaks of memory leak plugs in authorization handling functions (hopefully
  now avoiding segmentation faults on linux 8-). - FM
* Include -lc in the first position of the LIBS= list for snake3 targets.
  - Donald S. Teiser <dsteis01@homer.louisville.edu)
* Enhancements of Makefile. - LWV
07-07-96
* Tweaks of code for uncompressing on the fly.  Will now force a download
  offer without uncompressing if there is no presentation mapping for the
  Content-Type. - FM
* Retain blank lines within TEXTAREA content (but not trailing blanks). - DT
07-07-96
* Added functions for uncompressing and handling documents which have
  Content-Encoding headers that indicate "x-gzip", "gzip", "x-compress",
  or "compress" (instead of forcing a download offer).  The files are
  not uncompressed if they were fetched via the 'd'ownload command.
  Note, however, that if you activate a link for a compressed image or
  other binary file, and don't have a viewer or helper app mapped for it,
  it will already have been uncompressed before a D)ownload or C)ancel
  offer can be made, so use the 'd'ownload command directly if it is
  your intention to download such files.  Note also that on VMS "gzip -d"
  is used for both gz and Z uncompression.  See the INSTALLATION file for
  info on getting the VMS port of gzip. - FM
07-06-96
* Allow any startfile and homepage in -validate mode even if they are not
  http URLs. - FM
* Made all the 'o'ptions menu statusline prompts and informational messages
  strings that can be defined in userdefs.h for different languages. - FM
* Mods to send one Accept header as a comma-separated list instead of a
  series of individual Accept header statements. - FM
07-05-96
* Added NO_FILE_REFERER configuration symbol and -nofilereferer switch
  for disabling transmissions of Referer headers for any file URLs (is
  a subset of what NO_REFERER_HEADER and -noreferer disable). - FM
* Tweaks to facilitate additions of security-related patches. - FM
07-04-96
* Added NEWS_CHUNK_SIZE and NEWS_MAX_CHUNK configuration symbols and
  -newschunksize and -newsmaxchunk switches for regulating the chunking
  of news article listings.  See comments in lynx.cfg for explanation. - FM
07-02-96
* Tweaks of URL_DOMAIN_PREFIXES and URL_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES handling (was
  doing double scheme prefixing under some circumstances). - FM
* Fixed problem of potential crashes with bad HTML which lacks any
  OPTION tags in SELECT containers (Yes, HTML that bad is really out
  there! 8-). - FM
* Fixed problem of potential infinite loop in HText_endAppend() for documents
  that contain nothing but SCRIPTs and empty OBJECT containers (as in the
  Microsoft ActiveX demos). -FM
07-01-96
* Added circular recall buffer for paths used as the second argument in
  'd'ownload and 'p'rint menu commands.  Use the up- and down-arrow keys
  to access then at the statusline prompt, equivalently to the recalls for
  previous 'g'oto URLs, 'j'ump shortcuts, and ISINDEX or WHEREIS search
  queries. - FM
* Modified the LYMail.c functions to work as intended with both curses
  and slang (through v0.9-33) on both Unix and VMS. - FM
06-30-96
* Changed yesterday's symbols to URL_DOMAIN_PREFIXES and URL_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES
  and added code to guess the scheme based on the first field of the domain
  name (e.g., gopher.wfbr.edu will become gopher://gopher.wfbr.edu instead
  an http://host URL).  Note also that a partial host string can contain a
  dot within it and still be tested with prefixes and suffixes if the DNS
  lookup fails with the host string as entered (e.g., cc.ukans will become
  http://www.cc.ukans.edu), and only dots at the end or beginning of the
  partial host string will block prepending or appending, respectively, of
  items from the prefix or suffix lists (e.g., ftp.foo. will block use of
  items from the prefix list, but permit tests from the suffix list, and
  will become ftp://ftp.foo.dom if the ftp.foo.dom lookup succeeds). - FM
06-29-96
* Added HTTP_DOMAIN_PREFIXES and HTTP_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES in userdefs.h and
  lynx.cfg for defining lists and setting the order of domain name prefixes
  and suffixes to use when creating http:// URLs from command line and
  'g'oto arguments which are not already URLs and cannot be opened via a
  file://localhost URL (see 05-30-96 entry). - FM
06-28-96
* Tweaks of MIME header handling. - FM
06-27-96
* Do not send a referer header for links obtained from the history list,
  bookmark file, or jumps file. - FM
* Made sorts by name case-sensitive in ftp and file listings. - FM
* Added osf-slang make target. - FM
* Enable ^C (SIGINT) interrupts during spawns on Unix (^C and ^Y interrupts
  were already being enabled for VMS ). - FM
* Fixed glitch in WHEREIS search handling. - Michael Barabanov
  (baraban@luz.cs.nmt.edu)
06-26-96
* Tweaks of ftp gateway for VM/CMS servers based on feedback from PG. - FM
* More tweaks of 'o'ptions menu and DISPLAY handling. - FM
* Tweaks for builds with WIN_TCP on VMS. - FM
06-24-96
* Modified 'o'ptions menu handling to allow NULLing of strings which were
  set at startup.  Note that if you NULL (or set) the DISPLAY variable,
  Lynx configured itself for X/Motif or not based on whether it was set
  (or NULL) at startup, and you need to restart Lynx to really change the
  configuration for 'd'ownload forces versus X/Motif viewer spawns. - FM
* More tweaks of language code, to make the HTCJK enum checks more
  portable. - FM
06-23-96
* Set up handling of nested DIV tags with ALIGN attributes (and CENTER,
  which is treated as DIV ALIGN="center"). - FM
* Removed INSERT, ALIAS and MH from the DTD, and their associated code
  from HTML.c and GridText.c. - FM
06-22-96
* Tweaks of character set handling. - FM
* Added function for graphic boxing of popups with curses on VMS. - FM
06-21-96
* Mods to translate CJK escape sequences and take Kanji into account when
  handling statusline() messages.  That's in effect if a CJK character set
  is selected, and regardless of the raw or CJK mode setting, because the
  strings are coming from definitions in userdefs.h, not the document that
  is being rendered or displayed. - FM
* Added more statusline() string definitions in userdefs.h. - FM
* Ignore a server's Content-Encoding header if it inappropriately indicates
  "8bit" or "7bit" (should be indicated a compression scheme). - FM
* Mods to use charset strings as in the 07-Jun-1996 HTTP/1.1 draft, and to
  check for those as well as their common synonyms. - FM
* Mods to revive clearok() functionality with the slang 0.99-33 library
  (need it for Kanji handling and for VMS), and to deal with the definition
  conflicts for the (poorly added) TRUE and FALSE definitions in the new
  slang library's SLcurses.h. - FM
06-20-96
* Added handling of the SFS file system on VM ftp servers, tested on
  ftp://ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu/ (be sure to escape the colons if you use SFS
  paths, e.g., ftp://ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu/vmsysu%3alistserv.webshare) - FM
* More memory management enhancements and leak plugs. - FM
* Added -DUNIX and -DSCO to the sco and sco5 libwww targets. - BL
06-17-96
* Added handling of &shy;, &#173;, and 8-bit 173 for ISO-Latin-1 documents,
  as a soft hyphen for all of the character sets. - FM
* Polished up and massively annotated the new character set handling
  code. - FM
* Made all the dummy libwww headers in WWW/Library/Implementation
  compatible with the new, actually used, headers in /src. - FM
* Fixed some bad ifdef-ing for statusline string definitions which
  were added to userdefs.h. - FM
06-15-96
* Added many more userdefs.h definitions for statusline() and HTAlert()
  messages. - FM
* Tweaks of ALT string handling when they are used as forced link names
  for USEMAP, AREA, IMG, EMBED or APPLET sources. - FM 
* Oops, hadn't put the new HTML.h in the zip. - FM
* Fixed casing typo for HTCJK.h inclusion in HTMIME.c. - LWV

* Updated the help files, lynx.man and lynx.hlp concerning the character
  set handling. - FM
* Changed the -jpn switch to a generic -raw switch, and the LYK_JPN_TOGGLE
  ('@') to a generic LYK_RAW_TOGGLE.  The toggling also can be done via
  the 'o'ptions menu, in conjunction with selecting character sets.  See
  the comments about CHARACTER_SET in userdefs.h and lynx.cfg for more
  information.  The toggle determines whether raw 8-bit characters in the
  document are assumed to be ISO-8859-1, and therefore translated for the
  non-"ISO Latin 1" character sets based on their LYCharSets.c arrays, or
  are assumed to match the character set (e.g, 8-bit ISO-8859-2 when the
  "ISO Latin 2" set is selected, or Kanji when a CJK set is selected) and
  therefore processed raw.  Use raw or CJK mode when you know the charset
  of the document is a match to your selected character set, but no header
  or suffix has indicated that the charset is not ISO-8859-1. Be careful
  about this when "Other ISO Latin" is selected, since the document could
  be, e.g., ISO-8859-3, but you are using, e.g., ISO-8859-5. - FM
* Added "Other ISO Latin", "Chinese", "Japanese (EUC)", "Japanese (SJIS)",
  "Korean", and "Taipei (Big5)", character sets, which presently translate
  8-bit ISO-8859-1 named and numeric entities to 7-bit approximations, and
  added a default "CHARACTER_SET" definition in userdefs.h, complementary
  to that in lynx.cfg. - FM
* Worked in the expanded CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) escape sequence and
  Kanji handling from Takuya ASADA's June 11, 1996 Lynx2-5CJK (available in
  ftp://ftp.three-a.co.jp/pub/www/lynx). - FM
06-11-96
* Tweak of the ftp gateway to handle Reflection Unix emulation servers. - FM
* Made lynx_version_putenv_command a global so we can free it at exit
  via free_lynx_globals() in LYMain.c. - FM
06-10-96
* Convert a 0xFFFF value from slang in LYgetch() to 7 (^G) to cancel
  whatever called it, instead of exiting on error. - FM
* Tweaks of Makefile to use symbolic, $(include) and $(lib) paths with
  ncurses for convex, NeXT and sun4, and for SOCKSLIB. - LWV 
* Tweaks of mail editor handling based on patch from Arne Riiber
  (riiber@systek.no). - FM
06-09-96
* Had overdone it plugging memory leaks and was freeing the proxy, news
  server, and lynx version variables too soon. - FM
06-07-96
* Moved the Kanji handling variables into HText structure elements to make
  the GridText.c functions reentrant for them, and added code for regulating
  them via charset parameters in server headers or META tags.  The recognized
  parameters are EUC-JP, Shift-JIS, ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-JP-2, and EUC-KR.
  E.g., a META with:
       	HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=Shift-JIS"
  will set up handling of the document as Shift-JIS. - FM
* Made handling of Kanji more reliable when SJIS is the default, based
  on the strategy in Takuya ASADA's Japanized Lynx2-4-2. - FM
* K&Rized the Ichikawa ISO-2022-JP MIME header handling functions and added
  them to HTMIME.c, together with Takuya ASADA's (asada@three-a.co.jp)
  function for guessing whether an escape has been lost and filling it in,
  and use them for checking news headers. - FM
* Retry DCL spawns without the TRUSTED flag if it was included and we
  got back an INVARG status. - Robert C. Gray (gray@cyberodyssey.com)
06-06-96
* Plugged lots of memory leaks. - FM
* Handle colons in code for expanding host names and prepending http://
  (e.g., wfbr:8002 will become http://www.wfbr.edu:8002/). - FM
* More tweaks of character conversions. - FM
* Block crashes if illegal markup such as Anchors are present in the
  OPTION strings for SELECT. - FM
06-04-96
* Mods of entity and end tag handling in SGML.c and LYCharUtils.c. - FM
* Tweaks of make target for sun4-slang. - NHE
06-03-96
* More tweaks of the ftp gateway. - FM
* More anti-crash protections for bad HTML. - FM
* Tweaks of LYCharUtils.c and SGML.c. - KW
* Enclose the username for rlogin URLs in double-quotes on VMS to preserve
  mixed casing if present. - Robert C. Gray (gray@cyberodyssey.com)
06-02-96
* Made DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE and DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE configurable via
  lynx.cfg. - FM
* Added comments in HTFTP.c to make more clear some of the counterintuitive
  things being done, and why. - FM
* Oops, had left my ISSPACE() debugging macro in HTFTP.c yesterday.  Is
  now back to isspace(). - FM
06-01-96
* Added support for ;type=I (or A or D) to specify Image or ASCII transfer 
  modes, or a Directory, in ftp URLs. - FM
* Added support for VM/CMS ftp servers.  Note that 'd'ownloaded text files
  will have CRLF as line terminators, due to their use of ASCII records
  (tested on ftp://pucc.princeton.edu/anonymou.376). - FM
* Added support for use of a tilde on Unix ftp servers to indicate that you
  want a listing of the user's login directory instead of the root (i.e.,
  ftp://user@host/~ or ftp://user@host/~username will cause Lynx to attempt
  a listing of the translated ~ or ~username).  Paths can be appended (e.g.,
  ftp://user@host/~/subdirectory).  This should not be used with anonymous
  ftp, or in public documents.  It yields the behavior on Unix or Unix-like
  ftp servers which should occur without the tilde, based on RFC 1738.  Note
  that the valid behavior involving use of %2f is implemented for VMS (see
  the 12-20-95 entry, below), but the behavior for Unix and Unix-like ftp
  servers emulates Lynx's Unix DIRED_SUPPORT. - FM
* Mods of CSO/PH gateway to deal with discontinuous field name tokens
  (e.g., "NYU fax" instead of "NYU_fax"). - FM
* More fixes for the putenv_command pointer in LYMain.c. - CC
* Add curly braces to the current hack for mininizing reversals of
  trace messages with slang. - KW
05-30-96
* Modified the http:// prepending code to try expanded host names if the
  the first (or only) element does not contain a dot and is not a known
  host name.  Will first try it as www.host.com, then www.host.edu, then
  www.host.net, then www.host.org, e.g., wfbr/dir/lynx will become an
  http://www.wfbr.edu/dir/lynx URL. - FM
* Added handling of MSDOS_SERVER ftp server type (tested on ftp.hayes.com)
  and corrected WINDOWS_NT_SERVER handling (tested on ftp.boca.org). - FM
* Reset any modified, non-HT-LEFT styles in HTML_free() if they were not
  reset in HTML_end_element() due to missing end tags. - FM
* Initialize the putenv_command pointer in LYMain.c. - Christophe Colle
  (colle@krtkg1.rug.ac.be)
* Include LYLocal.h in LYCgi.c. - Carl Hansen (hansen@best.com)
05-28-96
* Made all mainloop() statusline() message strings definitions in userdefs.h
  for easier modification to other languages (we'll move them to a catalog
  someday 8-). - FM
* Added string definitions in userdefs.h for statusline messages identifying
  active or DISABLED radio buttons. - FM
* More tweaks of character conversions.  Note that numeric entities with
  values greater than 255 are displayed as text, until we are able to
  handle them as Unicode.  - FM
* Implemented ID handling for BDO. - FM
05-27-96
* Added nested handling of Q, so that it alternates between double-quotes
  and single-quotes, with directionality of start and end single-quotes
  (should someday check the LANG and DIR attributes, and character set,
  to use other quoting conventions if appropriate). - FM
* Use [DEL: ... :DEL] labeling to indicate DEL content, and [INS: ... :INS]
  labeling to indicate INS, S, and STRIKE content. - FM
* Added ID handling for ABBREV, ACRONYM, AU, AUTHOR, BIG, DEL, INS, Q, S,
  SMALL, SUB, SUP and SPAN. - FM
* Added code to clear the screen of any trace messages directed to the
  screen, once the full page has been created. - FM
* Added code to minimize slang's casting of trace messages as reverse when
  directed to the screen instead of a file. - FM
05-26-96
* More tweaks of character conversions. - FM
* Added submit_enctype elements to the forms structures as will be needed to
  implement INPUTS with TYPE="file" (someday 8-), and set disabled for FORM
  fields if the ENCTYPE is multipart/form-data, until we can handle that
  (someday 8-), so the user won't fill out the FORM pointlessly. - FM
* Made the third argument of SLang_init_tty() 1 so that '\n' will be treated
  as CRLF when trace messages are sent to the screen instead of to a file.
  Might cause problems with the slang screen management functions, but
  doesn't seem to according to KW. - FM
05-25-96
* Mods to pass 8-bit control characters entered via the line editor.  They
  should be assumed to be valid if the user entered them, and could indeed
  be valid for Japanese and Russian. - FM
* Check for a NULL return value from initscr() on Unix. - Geert Jan de Groot
  (GeertJan.deGroot@ripe.net)
* Tweaks of character conversions, and of 8-bit character handling with
  slang. - Klaus Weide (kweide@tezcat.com)
* Added TRUSTED_URL for specifying lynxexec and lynxprog URLs which always
  are permitted, based on patches from David Drum (david@more.net). - FM
05-21-96
* Made the LOCAL_DOMAIN symbol configurable via lynx.cfg. - FM
* Added descriptions of the quality (q=) and maxbytes (mxb=) parameters
  in the sample mailcap file. - FM
* Added a maxbytes element to the libwww presentation and converter
  structures, and code for specifying a maximum for mailcap entries via
  a semi-colon-separated mxb=value field, where "value" is a positive
  integer (e.g., ; mxb=1000000).  The default is 0, meaning no maximum.
  If the value exceeds 0, a maxbytes parameter will be appended in the
  Accept: header for the Content-Type. - FM
05-20-96
* Added code for specifying a quality parameter for mailcap entries via
  a semi-colon-separated q=value field, where "value" is a floating point
  number (e.g., ; q=0.002), and for appending the quality parameters in
  Accept: headers if the values are less than 1.0. - FM
* Treat screen width as 80 for the startup page when doing traversals with
  a slang-build Lynx to prevent a crash. - FM
05-19-96
* Mods in HTML.c to make resolving of local file URLs more efficient. - FM
* Tweaks of Makefile for slang. - Ed Doolittle (dolittle@math.toronto.edu)
05-18-96
* Added FRAME elements and attributes to the DTD, and code for creating
  links to the SRCs. - FM
* Added numerous sanity checks for valid but inappropriate combinations
  of attributes based on the HTML 3.2 DTD.
05-17-96
* Added support for TYPE and VALUE attributes of LIs in OLs.  TYPEs
  are equivalent to those for OL, and VALUE is equivalent to START
  or SEQNUM for OL.  See the 11-28-95, 10-17-95, 09-19-95 and 09-04-95
  entries in this file.  If a TYPE is changed via an LI, the change
  persists for subsequent LIs of that OL.  The VALUE set for an LI
  similarly increments for subsequent LIs in that OL. - FM
05-16-96
* Made SGML_character() in SGML.c fully reentrant. - FM
* Set up capturing of marked sections, and DOCTYPE, ELEMENT, ATTLIST and
  ENTITY declarations in SGML.c.  Lynx doesn't do anything with them yet,
  besides reporting them in trace mode, but they at least won't create
  garbage in the display if they start being used for the "next generation"
  of clients. - FM
* Set up base code for CSIs (Client Side Includes, homologous to SSIs).
  See the comments for LYDoCSI() in LYUtils.c.  It should be moved to a
  separate module if someone wants to work on CSIs seriously.  LYDoCSI()
  is called from SGML.c if the document was obtained via a file URL on
  the local host and has comments that begin with "!--#". - FM
05-15-96
* Add a MIME charset parameter to POST Content-Type headers if it's not
  ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII and the server included the parameter when it
  sent the form (but don't do it simply on the basis of the user's current
  character set, because if the server didn't include the parameter, it's
  CGI script probably won't parse the client header either, and will return
  an error instead of processing the form submission). - FM
05-14-96
* Tweaks for Unixware and addition of a unixware-slang Makefile target based
  on patches from Thanh Ma (tma@encore.com). - FM
* Tweaks for SCO and addition of an sco5 Makefile target based on patches
  from Bela Lubkin (filbo@armory.com). - FM
* Include ;q=0.001 for the wildcard (*/*) Accept header. - FM
05-13-96
* Added support for a host field in news URLs, analogous to that for nntp
  URLs.  Though illegal according to the current RFCs, discussions with a
  W3C member about this Netscapism indicate that Lynx may as well support
  it now, rather than continue failing when it is encountered. - FM
05-12-96
* Added an explicit GetYX definition for slang in LYForms.c. - FM
05-11-96
* Eliminated the NCURSESINCDIR compilation symbol and added NCURSESHEADER,
  so the default now is to seek ncurses/curses.h and -DNCURSESHEADER invokes
  a seek for the (now obsolete 8-) ncurses.h. - FM
* Added an explicit GetYX definition for slang in LYStrings.c (now avoids
  reference to stdscr). - FM
* Mods in tcp.h for TCPWARE builds on VMS with DECC. - FM
05-08-96
* Fixed typo in Makefile entry for linux. - LWV
05-07-96
* Added LYPassHighCTRL boolean for passing normally illegal 8-bit control
  characters, and set it TRUE when the KOI8-R character set is selected
  (note that they also are passed when Japanese character support is
  toggled ON). - FM
05-06-96
* Mods in SGML.c to handle "<URL:" as text instead of an unknown tag. - FM
05-05-96
* Added typecasts of the third arguments for the getsockname() and
  accept() calls in HTFTP.c to void pointers, to avoid conflicts with
  their declarations as int versus unsigned int across platforms and
  flavors. - FM
* Renamed the for-VMS opendir(), readdir() and closedir() to HTVMSopendir(),
  HTVMSreaddir() and HTVMSclosedir(), and the for-UCX ioctl() to HTioctl(),
  to avoid possible conflicts with their additions to newer versions of
  VMS and UCX. - FM
05-04-96
* Fixed typo which was placing a space instead of a slash between the
  User-Agent name and version. - Tim Rowley (tor@cs.brown.edu)
