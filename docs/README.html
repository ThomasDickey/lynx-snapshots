<h1>How to obtain the Lynx help files</h1>

The Lynx help files are included with the distribution of
Lynx sources and documentation.  Links to sites which supply
the distribution are maintained in
<a href="http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html"
>Lynx links</a>.

<p>Once you have downloaded and extracted the distribution,
set HELPFILE in the lynx.cfg as: 
file://localhost/FULL_PATH_TO_HELP_FILES/lynx_help_main.html

<p>Additional instructions for HELPFILE configuration are in the
lynx.cfg file.
