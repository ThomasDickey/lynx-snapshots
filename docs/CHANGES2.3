--- RELEASE of 2.3  (19-May-1994) ---
5-19-94
* Better memory allocation routines used for some VMS systems.
5-19-94
* Non-interactive (-source) access to documents requiring access authorization
  not allowed to avoid crashes.
3-30-94
* Lynx exports the environment variable LYNX_VERSION on UNIX systems
  with the current version number as the value.
3-29-94
* added "action=" handling to ISINDEX tags.  (Is that in the spec?)
3-27-94
* fixed Telnet security problem
3-19-94
* added .mailcap and mailcap support as well as mime.types support
  for the configuration of viewers and extension mappings.
  The test command is now implemented so that viewers can be conditionally
  setup.
3-17-94
* Revamped the FTP code to recognize different server types and to parse
  full directory listings (LIST output).  File types, sizes and dates
  are displayed when possible.
3-16-94
* added transparent support for mosaic bookmark files.  Just point
  Lynx at your existing default mosaic bookmark file and Lynx will
  handle the rest.  Viewing, addition, and removal are supported.
3-15-94
* added second line of reverse video to show multiline links better.
3-10-94
* added configurable MIME types and viewers to lynx.cfg.  MIME types
  and VIEWERS can be configured by following the instructions within
  the newest lynx.cfg file.
3-?-94
* added second %s argument to PRINTER and DOWNLOADER definitions.
  If a second %s is present in the command definition it will be
  filled in by a suggested filename which is derived from the URL
  of the document.  See lynx.cfg for more details.
3-?-94
* got code from CERN to fix HTBTree FTP bug.  Large ftp lists should
  not crash anymore.
3-9-94
* added no_proxy environment variable.  set it to a comma delimited list
  of domains or hosts that should not be proxyed. (Thanks CERN :)
  USAGE: (UNIX)
     setenv no_proxy "domain1.dom, domain2.dom, domain3, etc"
3-?-94
* Fixed Referer: field handleing so that it doesn't crash on really
  long URL's
3-?-94
* True popup menus are now supported for non-multiple SELECT lists.
2-28-94
* fixed the delete-a-bookmark command and bound it to 'r' for remove.
  (thanks to David Trueman for the fix)

---------- RELEASE of 2.2 ------------------
2-9-94
* added 'd' for download current link.  Can be used to force a download
  of any file.
* 'r' removed as a comment key.  Use 'c' or reconfigure your keys to
  add 'r' back in.  (I would like to use 'r' in the future to mean
  remove current bookmark link)
* Found the bug in the HTTP redirection code that was causing it
  not to work.  So HTTP redirection appears to work now!
* Added Referer: header to HTTP requests to list the URL of
  the document listing the requsted URL.   Here's an extract from CERN:
     This optional header field allows the client to specify,
     for the server's benefit, the address ( URI ) of the document
     (or element within the document) from which the URI in the
     request was obtained.

     This allows a server to generate lists of back-links to documents,
     for interest, logging, etc.  It allows bad links to be traced
     for maintenance.

2-8-94
* changed novice line to be displayed on bottom two lines with the
  status line moved up two lines.
1-27-94
* Made configurable keymappings a reality.  Keys can be remapped in
  the lynx.cfg file.  (diffs from David Trueman)
* Got code from Foteos to make 'a' work for VMS connection interrupts.
1-24-94
* Moving closer towards configurable keymappings.  New keyhandleing
  code will make it very easy to implement. (diffs from David Trueman)
1-14-94
* Lynx FTP now supports PASV code. (fixes to CERN (Dave Raggert?) PASV code
  from John Ellson)  It is not enabled by default.  Line 43 in
  WWW/Library/Implementation/HTFTP must be commented out for
  PASV code to be used.  This was done because not all FTP sites
  can support PASV FTP.
1-13-94
* slight change in forms user interface.  For the better, I hope you will
  agree.  Text input fields are now active as soon as the cursor pointer
  is over them.  Therefore you may begin typing into the text field
  as soon as you come to it.  Tab, and up and down arrow keys will
  move off of the text input field.  The only problem with this is as
  follows.  If you are in the habit of using the number keys (keypad)
  the or h,j,k,l vi keys, as soon as you move over the text link
  you will begin seeing numbers or hjk or l show up in the text field.
  In other words, your movement commands are now broken :(  You must
  use true arrow keys or the tab key to move off of the text field.
  I've tried this out and it seems to work alright.  I don't think
  that users unfamiliar with this will have too hard a time figureing
  it out.  Once you see numbers or letter appearing it becomes fairly
  obvious whats going on.  I'll put a message at the bottom of the
  screen saying "use tab or arrow keys to move off of link."
* added mods by David Trueman to implement -restrictions commandline
  option.  -restrictions allows a list of services to be disabled
  selectively. -restrictions takes the form of
  "lynx -restrictions=[default],[all],[inside_telnet],[outside_telnet],[shell],\
	[editor],[bookmark],[option_save],[print],[file_url],[download],[exec]"

   all             restricts all options.
   default         same as commandline option -anonymous.  Disables
	           default services for anonymous users.  Currently set to,
	           all restricted except for: inside_telnet, outside_telnet, and
	           goto.  Defaults settable within userdefs.h
   inside_telnet   disallow telnets for people coming from inside your
		   domain.
   outside_telnet  disallow telnets for people coming from outside your
		   domain.
   shell	   disallow shell escapes
   editor	   disallow editing
   bookmark	   disallow changing the location of the bookmark file.
   options_save    disallow saving options in .lynxrc
   print           disallow most print options
   goto            disable the 'g' (goto) command.
   file_url        disallow using G)oto to go to file: URL's
   download        disallow saving binary files to disk in the download menu.
   exec            disable execution scripts
   exec_frozen     disallow the user from changing the execution link
		   setting in the O)ptions menu.
1-12-93
* added new more informative messages for form links.
1-11-93
* fixed -dump and -source options so that they work for
  binary files now.
* Interruptable I/0 now completely works for UNIX systems.
  VMS is next.  Just hit an 'a' for abort anytime during a
  transfer to abort.  If there is a partial file to show, it
  will be shown.
* Added command line option -show_curser.  If enabled the curser
  will not be hidden in the right hand corner but will instead
  be positioned at the start of the currently selected link.
  show curser is the default for systems without FANCY_CURSES
  capibilities, and the default configuration can be changed in
  userdefs.h
1-9-93
* Added NNTP posting capibilities.  Currently uses external inews
  program which will be included in the utils directory.
  Would someone like to patch in some freeware inews code, or
  send me some?
1-7-93
* fixed bug in password handling which cuased it to be displayed
  accidentally :(  (Danny Mayer)
1-6-94
* bold and emphasis now use curses underlining to represent
  ephasized text.  The use of _underline_ chars before and after
  the text is now removed.
1-5-94
* Added configurable download menu so that binary files may
  be downloaded using any protocal.  Download menu is displayed
  after selecting a non-displayable file.
* Added exec links.  4 types currently defined:
    files ending in:  .csh, .ksh, .sh, (for UNIX)  and .com (for VMS);
  Use exec link controls to turn on and off exec links.
* Gopher menues are now within PRE so that spaces are not
  collapsed in menu entries.
* added configurable character sets.  Can be set in lynx.cfg
  by the user in the options screen or in the users .lynxrc file
  current sets are: ISO Latin I, IBM PC Character set, & 7 bit
  approximations.  New sets can be added to src/LYCharSets.c

----------RELEASE of Lynx 2.1 and 2.1.1----------------------
-grey area-
* Ability to FTP to VMS systems. (Foteos Macrides)
* Fixed lots of display and interupt problems (Foteos Macrides)
* The Lynx Bookmark file is now interpreted as an HTML document.
  Old Lynx bookmark files must be converted using the lynx2html
  program or deleted.
* HTML+ forms as implemented by XMosaic now work.
  fill in the empty spaces and press the submit button to
  submit the form.
* The TEXTAREA tag isn't done yet.  It will currently only
  give a one line text area.  The next version of Lynx will
  include a true textarea implementation once I figure out a
  reasonable interface.
* Incorporated WWWlib 2.14 and fixed up the descrip.mms files.
  Foteos Macrides made VMS port changes and wrote a really nice
  build.com script to make compilation on VMS systems really easy.
  Foteos also ported Lynx to OpenVMS for alpha axp systems.
* 's' now means search a searchable indexed document through the
  server, and can no longer be used to search for strings within
  the displayed document.
* '/' now only searches through the current displayed document for
  strings and can not be used for searchable index documents.
* Capital 'Q' now quits without asking for confirmation.

  internal format document links
* local documents ending in .html can now be referenced with
  just a filename and/or path from the command line.

10-19-93
* Added preloaded searches to gopher URL's.  They previously
  didn't work.  This is readily apparent as preloaded CSO
  searches, which alot of people wanted.
* removed old hytelnet compatibility code which looked in
  multiple directories to find the correct file.  If you still
  need this capibility talk to me.

10-12-93
* The users specified editor is now spawned for mail messages.
  If no editor is defined or if the user is anonymous, the built-in
  lynx mail sender is used.

10-11-93

  (instead of ISOLATIN1), protected by #ifdef LOCALE (Nickolay Saukh)

------Release of Lynx 2.0.11--------------------------------
8-27-93
* Caused major international incident when a large bug was discovered after
  release. :)
* Fixed internal document hypertext refernces with URL's.  '#selector'
  strings now work again.

8-24-93
* When files come through on pre HTTP/1.0 servers they are now
  recognized by their file extensions

8-23-93

* fixed ALT bug that had to do with style changes not
  happening before the alt was printed.

8-21-93
* updated the man file lynx.1.

8-19-93
* updated help and converted it to HTML.  Made a new help location and
  server.  The new default help file is
  http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html

8-15-93
* changed '\' to toggle between source and no source.  When you press
  '\' while viewing a rendered HTML document you will get the HTML source
  when you press '\' while viewing HTML source you will get the
  rendered HTML.
* Added ALT attribute to IMG tag.  When ALT is available the contents
  are displayed.  When ALT is missing [IMAGE] is displayed.  When
  ALT="" nothing is displayed.

8-14-93
* Added document reload command.  CTRL-R when pressed will reload
  the document into memory and redisplay it, clearing the screen.
  This is very useful when editing documents, outside of Lynx while
  using Lynx for rendering.
* Added source view mode.  '\' when pressed will reload the document
  and display the HTML source. (doesn't work for gopher directoryies right
  now, but gopher isn't HTML anyways)
* fixed bug in LibWWW that caused it not to be able to convert to
  www/source.
* fixed bug in LibWWW that caused most binary file transfers to fail
* added binary file transfer ability.  When binary files are selected
  the user is prompted for a file name to save to.  The default directory
  is the one the user started in.
* Lynx now reloads local HTML files and re-renders them after editing.

??-??-??
* At some point I added the ability to edit HTML files on the local
  machine.

8-12-93
* Added Nested Lists, up to six levels, with different bullets
  for each level.
* Due to the fact that nearly everyone seems to use P to mean
  two returns within the same style, and Mosaic has been kind
  enough to support this meaning, :( :( :(  I have changed
  the P tag to reflect this interpretation.  P can be used
  anywhere and will mean insert two returns.  (i.e., two BR tags)

8-11-93
* Made the default Mime type for unknown file types on ftp servers
  to be text/plain.  Previously the WWWLibrary had the default
  as application/octet-stream which meant that most files could not
  be viewed.
* Changed the ADDRESS style to be more like XMosaic
  Left flush, newline top and bottom
* The Statusline now displays the URL when retrieving files.
* added BR (linebreak) tag!
  The BR tag inserts a line break and maintains the current style!
  The BR tag may be used anywhere.
* added HR (horizontal rule tag!)
  The HR tag puts a horizontal line seperating two bodies of text.
  The HR tag may be used anywhere.

8-8-93
* All spaces, tabs and returns are now collapsed down do one
  space.
* fixed bug whiched caused certain links beginning at the
  begining of a line to be bad.
* added '*' (stars) to unordered lists and numbers to ordered
  lists.
* changed dir lists to be more like menu lists.
* all emphasis, physical and symantic, now have _underlines_
  around them to show emphasis.

bookmark page.

5-30-93
Fixed problem with ftp: URL not being recognized and not working.
