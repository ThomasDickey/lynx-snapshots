Changes since Lynx 2.8 release
===============================================================================

1999-06-01 (2.8.2rel.1)
-----------------------
1999-06-01 (2.8.2pre.11)
* minor fixes from W3C HTML validation -TD
* update links to HTML'ized lynxcfg in users' guide -VH
1999-05-31 (2.8.2pre.10)
* add links to HTML'ized lynxcfg to users' guide -LP
* cleanup temporary files left by
     lynx -dump LYNXCFG:// > /dev/null
  (analysis by LP) -VH
* add comments to lynx.cfg describing effect of restricting configuration
  settings in nested includes -VH
* delineate URL's in README with "<URL:" and ">", with space in lynx.man -LV
* add some comments to lynx.lss -TD
* minor improvements to configure script:  use newer config.guess and
  config.sub from xterm, which adds case for HP 9000/800 (fix problem reported
  by Peter Jones <jones.peter@uqam.ca>) -TD
1999-05-29 (2.8.2pre.9)
* use StrAllocCopy rather than HTSprintf in LYstore_message() because no
  formatting is done there; the message may contain formatting controls such as
  %s (related to bug report by Frederic L W Meunier <fredlwm@urbi.com.br>) -TD
* add/use function LYRenamedTemp() to update our record of temporary filename
  when using external decompression program, so we will remove the decompressed
  file correctly on exit.  This is the usual case if we do not link with zlib
  (reported by HN) -TD
* modify LYValidateFilename() to derive original directory preferably from
  Current_Dir() rather than environment variable $PWD, since the $PWD directory
  may not be writable if Lynx is invoked from another application rather than
  directly from the command line -TD
* add/use function Current_Dir(), to check for failure in getcwd/getwd -TD
* change ALL_LINGUAS assignment in configure script to use the .po file which
  actually reside in the po directory, making it simpler to drop/add message
  files from a distribution of Lynx.  Also, make the assignment contigent on
  ALL_LINGUAS not being set externally, making it simple to override -TD
1999-05-28 (2.8.2pre.8)
* when reloading/reparsing the document with forms, issue a warning only when
  user input is detected (forms content is changed from its default so
  information will be lost).  New function HText_HaveUserChangedForms() is
  called from HTReparse_document() and HTuncache_current_document() -LP
* fix exit from postoptions() when need_reload is set but no source_cache,
  was broken in dev23 -LP
* remove unneeded float from integer calculations -LP
* move comment for 'const' off the definition line, to simplify debugging
  configure problem on HPUX for David Eaton -TD
* move LYGetYX() out of conditional expression, just in case it cannot be
  evaluated as a function, i.e., return a value (from bug report by David
  Eaton) -TD
* make install for COPYHEADER and COPYING work when the build directory is not
  the top source directory -PG
* add check to FastTrimColorClass() to avoid updating stylename and pointer
  into it when the tag to be trimmed is not found (fixes a core dump reported
  by VH) -TD
1999-05-25 (2.8.2pre.7)
* update illustration of forms options menu in Lynx User Guide according to
  current lynx output -LP
* old-style options menu:  hot key for "local e(X)ecution links" is now
  displayed in bold (call addlbl() instead of addstr() like the other options
  do), adapted from Hiroyuki diffs -LP
* fix handling of incorrect html in psrc mode.  If a piece of html matched the
  pattern "<known_tag_name unknown_attr_name any_attr_name>", then styles of
  internal markup were unbalanced - resulted in cluttered colors -VH
* comment-out (for release) configure option --enable-libjs -TD
* change configure script defaults for --enable-persistent-cookies and
  --enable-alt-bindings to 'yes' -TD
* add DESTDIR variable to top-level makefile to facilitate packaging releases
  with compiled-in pathnames -TD
* further correction to VMS pathname in HFTPLoad.c, to translate /vms/fileserv/
  to [vms.fileserv], for example.  The wku fileserver gives back a Unix-style
  listing rather than VMS-style when given a Unix-style CWD, which confuses
  Lynx into discarding the listing (reported by Andy Harper) -TD
* modify LYCookies.c to append new items to the end of the list rather than
  at the start, so cookies will be written and read from .lynx_cookies in
  consistent order (reported by KED) -TD
1999-05-24 (2.8.2pre.6)
* fix for problem reported by LP -VH
  Load an html file with META charset and switch "\" to source mode.  Now press
  ^R to reload:
  (1) In -prettysrc case you got a broken document (charset will be assumed by
    lynx from assume_charset or assume_local_charset, not from a META charset
    which was previously pushed with LYPushAssumed() so you get a problem with
    8bit documents when assume_charset != META charset).
  (2) Without -prettysrc you got a document handled properly via META charset
    assumption.  Now if you press ^R again you will get a broken document.
* LYK_SOURCE & HTreparse_document():  when using SOURCE_CACHE_MEMORY fix tiny
  charset problem when switching to the source mode and the original document
  have its charset specified.  Now aligned with SOURCE_CACHE_NONE and
  SOURCE_CACHE_FILE.  More LYK_SOURCE fixes that might affect next coming
  document in come cases (mainly Info page and Options menu, which now show
  correct charset information) -LP
* add CTRACE_FLUSH call before fork() in NSL_FORK logic so child's messages
  will not mess parent ones -LP
* add a few trace messages -LP
* HTReadProgress message now display statusline properly in TRACE mode
  (was always broken since early HTReadProgress days) -LP
* install COPYING and COPYRIGHT for install-help rule as well as install-doc,
  so we can refer to local copies of those files -TD
* tweak HTParse trace message -LP
* minor formatting change for Lynx_users_guide.html -Hiroyuki
* correct a few mismatches between variable declarations (char vs BOOLEAN)
  (from win32 version by Hiroyuki Senshu <senshu@shonai-cit.ac.jp>).
1999-05-20 (2.8.2pre.5)
* correct links to COPYHEADER and COPYING in about_lynx.html, by pointing to
  author's URLs, rather than to files which are not installed anyway -PG
* shorten a couple of identifiers to keep with 31-character limit:
  hash_code_aggregate_lower_on_fly -> hash_code_aggregate_lower_str
  LYprint_statusline_messages_on_exit -> LYstatusline_messages_on_exit
  (reported by Andy Harper) -TD
* correct VMS pathname in HTFTPLoad(), allowing connect to
  ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/fileserv (reported by Andy Harper) -TD
* chartrans:  cpXXXX Microsoft codepages verified against ftp.unicode.org -
  apparently cp1256 (Arabic) was updated recently.  Although Arabic letters are
  hardly useful for lynx (no right-to-left support) this codepage is supported
  under chrtrans.  So update, just for fun -LP
* fix core dump when starting "lynx LYNXOPTIONS:" command.  All phases of forms
  options logic now handled by postoptions():  LYNXOPTIONS:/ without post_data
  create a page (gen_options() now PRIVATE), LYNXOPTIONS:/ with post_data do
  proccess changes as before.  Also LYK_ADD_BOOKMARK fixed:  forms options page
  will not be added to bookmarks file -LP
* modify HTGetRelLinkNum(), removing increment of HText_getTopOfScreen() value
  so checks for line number begin at the very top of the screen, fixing a
  problem reported when processing the 123[g][+-] command -LE
* minor change to LYReadCFG.c to combine similar gettext'd strings -HN
1999-05-16 (2.8.2pre.4)
* add 'fixit' parameter to LYEnsureAbsoluteURL() to suppress logic in
  LYConvertToURL() that was changed in 2.8.1dev.4, to re-offer the original
  string after an invalid URL is entered at a 'g' prompt.  The calls to support
  'g' are unmodified; other calls revert to the older behavior (recommended by
  KW) -TD
* add/use string functions that make EBCDIC comparisons sort in the ASCII
  collating sequence, eliminating some special ifdef's in HTMLDTD.c -PG
* when STARTFILE cannot not be loaded, lynx now exits with more understandable
  status messages:  all important statusline messages are now printed to
  stderr/stdout -LP
* add definition for _DECC_V4_SOURCE for VMS SOCKETSHR_TCP configuration to
  top-level and ./src build*.com files (reported by Andy Harper) -TD
* change UNKNOWN_URL_TYPE to 1, to keep it distinct from NOT_A_URL_TYPE, fixes
  an error introduced when changing UrlTypes to an enum (reported by KW) -TD
1999-05-12 (2.8.2pre.3)
* add DEBUG_SOURCE_CACHE makefile flag so all documents will be cached in
  SOURCE_CACHE mode, including local files.  Normally undef'ed so only http
  served documents cached with sources -LP
* in LYK_HISTORY, set newdoc.link = 1 so position at link #2 bypassing "recent
  statusline messages" link -LP
* comment out "partial_thres=" option in .lynxrc (it was coded so the changes
  from lynx.cfg file could not be activated) -LP
* add a sanity check to LYCurses.h to point out problems with the FANCY_CURSES
  configure checks -TD
* fix uninitialized pointer used in decoding of -term switch (patch by Sergey
  Svishchev)
* define _DECC_V4_SOURCE for VMS SOCKETSHR_TCP configuration, to fix conflict
  with unistd.h versus non-POSIX prototypes in the other headers (report by
  Andy Harper) -TD
* ifdef'd includes for HTUtils.h to limit size of preprocessor listings with
  DEC C; verify that all header files include definitions needed for their
  contents -TD
* add docs/OS-390.announce (Paul Gilmartin <pg@sweng.stortek.com>)
* add fallback extern declaration for h_errno to HTTCP.c for systems that have
  that variable but do not declare it (reported by Jean-Pierre Radley
  <jpr@jpr.com> for SCO OpenServer 5.0.5) -BL
* correct SortaSGML element info: SPAN can contain SPAN -KW
* fix several small memory leaks (John Bley):
  + minor (~ 7 bytes) leak in LYCookie.c
  + leak in the warning message about invalid cookies
  + obvious leak in do_readme
  + small leak in dired_options (LYLocal.c)
  + leak with -selective option in HTFile.c
  + a few leaks and a minor cleanup in local_dired
1999-05-08 (2.8.2pre.2)
* substitute a few more free()s with FREE()s in files HTString.c and
  LYReadCFG.c (John Bley)
* fix buffer problems with long filenames and custom DOWNLOADERs (John Bley)
* fix typical alloc-fail-return-error-without-free leakage in
  save_bookmark_link (LYBookmark.c) (John Bley)
* modify generated WWW/*/makefile and src/chrtrans/makefile to omit include
  from intl directory if it is not used (report by LP) -TD
* add configure test for h_errno, by splitting CF_ERRNO macro and reusing
  test for external data.  Noticed that DECL_ERRNO was not defined/used,
  added that as well.  The h_errno symbol is provided in some network
  libraries, e.g., on SCO and Linux, but may/may not be declared (report
  by BL) -TD
* fix some serious lossage in lookup_reject (LYTraversal.c): memory and
  logic errors.  This (replaced) line is one for the record books:
      frag = strlen(buffer) - 1; /* real length, minus trailing null */
  Previously, this code caused a read before an array boundary as well as
  failing to compare the right number of characters in a pattern (John Bley)
* fix some minor leakage in the cookie jar (John Bley)
* fix up some casts and mode_t types in HTAAProt.c, HTFile.c, LYLocal.c,
  LYUtils.c (John Bley)
1999-05-05 (2.8.2dev.26 - 2.8.2pre.1)
* remove some weird cruft from HTAAUtil.h (yeah, "/home2/luotonen" is a good
  default path) (John Bley)
* correct a buffer overflow in LYDownload.c (reported by John Bley) -TD
* 8bit attribute values are now translated in psrc view (reported by LP) -VH
* trailing ';' now is shown after HTML entities (reported by LP) -VH
* split-up/correct typo in text at top of generated bookmark file -JS, -TD
* allow anchors as input for commands 'g','G','E' -VH
* correct off-by-one error in pointer to filename in DOSPATH configuration for
  LYPathLeaf() -DK
* fix infinite recursion bug in lynx.cfg includes, from dev.25 integration
  (reported by LP) -VH
* implement the following separators in lynx.cfg "include" commands:
  ":" on Unix
  " for " on all OS's -VH
* fixes for LYList.c,  adding title info to the (mostly unused) HTLinkType -KW
* change remaining <banner>'s to <blockquote> in other html files, fix
  a few escapes that tidy (15-apr-99) reports.  Leaving <tab>'s alone for the
  moment because there appears to be no standard equivalent -TD
* change <banner> in lynx-dev.html to <blockquote> since the latter is
  standard, correct IEFT version and supply <p>'s as needed (Karl Eichwalder)
* correct a couple of two documentation inconsistencies in the sources for
  USE_PSRC and -prettysrc (Karl Eichwalder <ke@gnu.franken.de>)
* register free_messages_stack with atexit to fix some statusline leakage,
  explicitly fill out a struct initializer (John Bley)
* fix a few html nits in the docs (John Bley)
* cleanup some gcc -Wundef warnings -TD
* add logic to free_lynx_cfg() to unset environment variables (requested by
  LP) -TD
* modify SafeHTUnEscape() to work with EBCDIC (pg@sweng.stortek.com)
* remove dangling comma in UrlTypes enum (reported by pg@sweng.stortek.com) -TD
* make description of STARTFILE in userdefs.h agree with lynx.cfg -TD
* fix:  newline position when we come from the history stack and cached HText
  is used (say, return from 'p'rint menu), was broken in dev23 -LP
* remove numerous HTMLSetCharacterHandling() calls from getfile(), use single
  call in mainloop instead -LP
* #define PUTS() in LYCookie.c and LYMap.c to make code more readable -LP
* fix:  LYmouse_menu() in LYStrings.c calls popup_choice(), which is #ifdef'd
  out when --disable-menu-options is used (patch by Sergey Svishchev)
* modify generated src/makefile to omit include from intl directory if it is
  not used.  This in turn required fixing a redefinition of gettext on Solaris
  when using cc, since the locale.h file includes Sun's libintl.h file which
  prototypes gettext.  Successfully built/ran using Sun's msgfmt utility, (had
  to manually add -lintl to src/makefile) though the generated message objects
  are incompatible, resulting in a core dump if not reinstalled (unnecessary
  include reported by LP) -TD
* change VMS WWW descrip.mms file to use prefix=all rather than prefix=ansi, so
  that POSIX functions such as 'read()' are linked properly (reported by Andy
  Harper) this is a detail I overlooked in dev.18 -TD
* fixes to compile with SunOS K&R cc -TD
1999-04-27 (2.8.2dev.25)
* updates to INSTALLATION -HN
* undo some redundant dev23 changes, in particular PSRC_TEST in HText_new
  was responsible for a wrong line breaking in -prettysrc mode
  (try "lynx .  -prettysrc" and press "\" to see wrapping with altered
  define).  Also fix Visited Links for internal pages -LP
* restore links in lynx-dev.html to original form, to make redirection work
  properly -TD
* add to MAKEFILE.W32 (untested - suggested by LP) -TD
  * definitions for DISP_PARTIAL;SOURCE_CACHE;USE_PSRC
  * lypretty.obj to the list of objects.
* remove CF_MAKE_INCLUDE from configure script, since it is not needed -TD
* merge WWW/Library/Implementation/CommonMakefile into WWW/.../makefile.in -TD
* corrections/simplification of LYSafeGets(), and remove sizeof(buf) from
  related code in LYCookie.c (analysis by KW) -TD
1999-04-23 (2.8.2dev.24)
* added overlooked WWW/Library/Implementation/makefile.in -TD
1999-04-23 (2.8.2dev.23)
* add/use new function LYSafeGets to replace reads into fixed-size buffers -TD
* change xxxx_URL_TYPE definitions in LYUtils.h to a enum -TD
* use HTSprintf0 in LYCurses.c, LYReadCFG.c -TD
* implement restrictions on options that can be set via the lynx.cfg "include"
  directive -VH
  For example, admins may specify
    include:~/.lynx/colors:COLOR
    include:~/.lynx/keymap:KEYMAP
    include:~/.lynx/viewers:VIEWER
  safely - and be sure that no critical options were altered by those files.
  The syntax is
    include:<filename>[:[<OPTNAME>* ] ]
  More samples:
    include:~/.lynx/rc:COLOR KEYMAP VIEWER SUFFIX
    include:/usr/local/lib/lynx-cfg.part: #all settings can be changed
  The patch does this:
  * It prints warnings to stderr about unknown options specified in the list of
    allowed options in include command.  When 'o'->'lynx.cfg'->'RELOAD THE
    CHANGES' is activated, these warnings are also printed on stderr - so the
    screen will be corrupted if lynx.cfg and included are incorrect.
  * Only options, allowed for a given file are printed in
    'o'->'lynx.cfg'->'RELOAD THE CHANGES'.
  * Fully backward compatible - lines of the form
	include:filename
    will work as they did(i.e., if the list of allowed options is not
    specified, then the included file can use the same set of options, as the
    file that contained that 'include' command).
  * If you wish to allow an included file to
    include others, you must specify 'include' in the list of allowed options.
    Sample:
	  include:~/.lynx/suffixes:INCLUDE SUFFIX
    so that users will be able to use 'include' command in '~/.lynx/suffixes'
    (otherwise included file will be unable to include anything).
  * Option sets are ANDed. If file lynx.cfg contains:
  	  include:/usr/lib/lynx.cfg.0:COLOR SUFFIX VIEWER INCLUDE
    and /usr/lib/lynx.cfg.0 contains
        include:/usr/lib/lynx.cfg.1:SUFFIX VIEWER INCLUDE STARTFILE HELPFILE
    then /usr/lib/lynx.cfg.1 can use the following options:
	SUFFIX VIEWER INCLUDE
* change the STARTFILE description in lynx.cfg to offer the user's home
  directory as an alternative to lynx.browser.org (amended this to reflect
  consensus that l.b.o should be the default) -TD
* move a big chunk of code into print_status_message() -LP
* also add numerous HTProgress messages to LYNXMESSAGES:/ page (but not
  HTReadProgress) -LP
* HTAlert, HTUserMsg and HTInfoMsg statusline messages are now stored in a
  cycled buffer and accessible from the History Page as LYNXMESSAGES:/ link.
  This allows us to decrease the messages delay in lynx.cfg when we feel
  messages too annoying, but have a nice history list for diagnostic purposes.
  Uses a 40-line buffer (suggested by Bela Lubkin) -LP
* fix reloading with HTreparse_document() for LYK_MINIMAL, LYK_HISTORICAL,
  LYK_SOFT_DQUOTES, LYK_SWITCH_DTD mainloop events (hope we work around replies
  from POST properly) -LP
* elaborate description in Lynx_users_guide.html for "comments" (Michael
  Sobolev <mss@transas.com>)
* fix --disable-trace (by making the ifdef's directly depend on NO_LYNX_TRACE
  rather than DEBUG), chop more unneeded #includes (John Bley)
* combine WWW/Library/unix and WWW/Library/Implementation to simplify make
  dependencies, drop Makefile.old -TD
* fixes for DOS port - DK
  (a) When exiting with interrupt, the message was printed in binary mode,
      leaving the cursor in the middle of the screen
  (b) In the PDCurses build, the keypad enter key only worked when LYK_ACTIVATE
      was utilized, but not in GOTOLINK or GOTOPAGE.  This maps the keypad
      enter to '\n', so it works in all situations, but keypad enter will no
      longer be able to be mapped separately.  CTRL-PADENTER and ALT-PADENTER
      can still be separately mapped.
* various changes to userdefs.h and lynx.cfg explanatory text -KW
* corrected placement of "partial_thres" code in LYrcFile.c, removed an unused
  prototype in LYUtils.h -KW
* add a note about LYNX_SAVE_SPACE to INSTALLATION -JS
* remove docs/*.old (request by HN) -TD
* update INSTALLATION notes for DJGPP with PDCurses; a suggested patch is
  no longer applicable -DK
* fixes for control/C and control/BREAK handling on DJGPP -DK
* tweak in HTML_start_element case HTML_DT:  prevent generation of empty line
  between multiple simple DT elements without intervening DD elements (Debian
  bug #3846) -KW
* add list of downloaders to lynx_help_main.html -PW
* add attributes for {bq,blockquote}.cite,{frame,iframe,img}.longdesc,
  {table,td}.background, td.{height,width} -VH
* define DISP_PARTIAL for VMS (request by Andy Harper) -TD
* include <unistd.h> for DEC C, to prototype sleep() and alarm().  Ifdef'd
  include of HTString.h by HTUtils.h, but keep include as general rule for
  making headers standalone (report by Andy Harper) -TD
* modified LYrcFile.c to avoid putting '#' characters at the beginning of
  lines, since that confuses VAX C (report by Tony Bolton) -TD
* fix redefinition of h_errno (report by Tony Bolton) -TD
* ifdef'd print_local_dir in HTFile.c since this function does not compile on
  VMS (report by Andy Harper, Tony Bolton) -TD
* fix reload_read_cfg() to avoid persistent cookies mode changing at run time;
  reload printers list, downloaders list, environments - as expected. - LP
* fixes for SOURCE_CACHE!=NONE mode, trying to accommodate HTreparse_document()
  for mainloop() events:
  - add/use flag "from_source_cache" for better mainloop maintenance
  - add partial display mode for HTreparse_document() operations
  - add warning when the reparsed document may lose its forms content
  - fix options menu stuff to use HTreparse_document() when possible - LP
* fix exit from postoptions() when the reloaded document was in source mode -LP
* update flags to correct behavior with SOURCE_CACHE!=NONE:  the length of the
  re-rendered text may vary so the scrolling down is broken (especially nice
  when switching to source).  ("more" updated, "lines_in_file" inlined) -LP
* use configure script macro CF_CHECK_CACHE to compile-in Unix SYSTEM_NAME,
  for info screen (request by LP) -TD
* minor fixes for uncaching document, other items missed in dev.22 -LP
* merge the two versions of start_curses() function -LP
* add -DSOURCE_CACHE and -DUSE_PSRC to djgpp makefiles -LP
* add a few words for CHANGES and INSTALLATION -LP
* add a configure option for prettysrc -TD
* separate ifdef's for prettysrc from color-style -LP
* fix for -prettysrc:  when pressing '\' on non-local files, the prettysrc view
  is shown, but there is no way out of this mode -VH
* change all PUTS() with a string of length 1 to PUTC(), fix a uid_t/int
  assumption in LYLocal.c, remove some unneeded #includes, remove some spurious
  semicolons.  (John Bley)
* fix typo in configure --help for --disable-direct (reported by LV) -TD
* update user's guide and lynx.cfg descriptions of jumps files - PW
* fixes for related bugs tweaked by going to an internal page while viewing
  source, and a few blurbs in the documentation -DSB
* fixes to separate RAW_MODE from internal variable LYRawMode by adding new
  variable LYUseDefaultRawMode -LP
* add a missing null-pointer check in expand_tiname() (from report by KW) -TD
1999-04-13 (2.8.2dev.22)
* correct a missing include for LYLeaks.h in UCAuto.c -TD
* implement HTML source caching.  In this implementation, each document kept in
  cache has associated with it a temporary file containing the HTML source for
  the document (well, not all of them -- only those using the HTTP protocol, on
  the premise that file:// documents are probably local and ftp:// documents
  are probably not HTML).  The temporary file is deleted when the document is
  uncached.  For certain operations, instead of reloading the document via
  HTLoad<mumble>(), the source file is reparsed with HTParseFile().  The cached
  document also remembers certain parser settings (screen size, historical vs.
  minimal vs.  valid comment parsing, and the like), and is regenerated from
  source if it is fetched out of cache under different settings.  This behavior
  is selectable by a configure option --enable-source-cache and by a lynx.cfg
  option SOURCE_CACHE; I didn't add a command-line argument or an options menu
  entry, as this didn't seem to be the sort of thing one would want to change
  You had to challenge me, didn't you?  ;) Okay, after some pfutzing around
  with HTChunks, I think I've got a working version of memory caching of
  source.  The SOURCE_CACHE option now has settings FILE, MEMORY and NONE, with
  the obvious meanings, defaulting to NONE.  (DSB - Scott Bigham
  <dsb@cs.duke.edu>)
* amend HTConfirmDefault() logic so that a second character will cause the
  default response to be returned, e.g,. so that pressing "qq" will make
  Lynx exit (reported by John Bley) - TD
* change the PUTS("\n") calls in HTFile.c to PUTC('\n') since that would be
  a little more efficient (noted by KW) - TD
* minor cleanup: remove obsolete parameters from command-line parsing functions
  in LYMain.c, add newlines in HTFile.c for readability of html - LP
* change default STARTFILE to the current directory, "." - PW
* revised lynx-dev.html - PW
* lynx.cfg and further included cfg files can be edited from LYNXCFG:/ page
  with the default editor and changes can be activated for the same lynx
  session.  NOT allowed for restricted users (LYRestricted) and occasionally
  for user mode other than ADVANCED.  This is an *experimental* code
  (reload_read_cfg() in LYMain.c - more work required):  currently command-line
  switches may be lost when overridden by lynx.cfg changes, file paths like
  lynx_save_space and LYCookieFile should not be changed (unwanted results) -LP
* retest PARSE_DEBUG ifdef's (LYMain.c, LYReadCFG.c), minor corrections
  but found no specific reason for LP's problem with tables, except possibly
  different effect from "&(value)" versus "(&value)" - TD
* fix the problem of reading included lynx.cfg files by changing LYReadCFG.c
  table signature (now it is more close to one in LYMain.c).  The problem was
  the ignoring of *some* values got from the included cfg file (at least for
  DJGPP2.02/gcc2.8.1 build).  Probably we calculate the addresses of variables
  on a later stage now.  - LP
* DOSPATH changes: local directory style now configurable from lynx.cfg
  (LONG_LIST defined).  Unlike UNIX it is not "ls -l" by default
  but a more compact form (date and size present, from lynx.cfg example) - LP
* cookies:  domains now match case insensitively (reported by Paul Wagner
  <paul.wagner@mci.com>) - LP
* correct an ifdef in LYGetFile.c for config-page - LP
* reading of long local directories now benefits from partial mode and fully
  interruptible.  Split out print_local_dir() function from HTLoadFile() - LP
* behave sanely if NSL_FORK fork() fails -BL
* NSL_FORK try for dns_patience *seconds*, not dns_patience select() calls,
  which might have been shortened by keyboard input  -BL
* fix some screwy comment indentation -BL
* add section on editing TEXTAREA to user's guide - PW
* add a null-pointer check in LYCookie.c (Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com>)
* revise changes ifdef'ing LY_FIND_LEAKS by making atexit a no-op function
  since the DOS port depends on atexit to keep the DOS BREAK function properly
  set on exit.  Put back atexit, and ifdef's each place where atexit isn't
  needed except when finding leaks - DK
* modify LYMain.c on DOS, fixing the determination of BREAK status to be
  independent of SLANG or PDCurses - DK
* spawn a new function, www_user_search_internals, to begin canceling the
  effects of cut-n-paste coding in www_user_search.  The body of
  www_user_search_internals used to be duplicated at two points in
  www_user_search.  See comment in GridText.c for more details.  (John Bley)
* big pile of unneeded #includes removed (John Bley)
* remove obsolete files from the distribution (John Bley)
  WWW/Library/Implementation/HTWriter.*
* one malloc check, fix --disable-ftp (John Bley)
* fixes for compiler warnings when building for OpenVMS 6.2 using DEC C and the
  SOCKETSHR library (reported by Andy Harper) - TD
* add cpp -H option for HPUX bundled C compiler, which otherwise does not
  have enough symbol table space (reported by JS).  Also, modify ifdef's
  for <stdarg.h> vs <varargs.h> to avoid including the former when ANSI_VARARGS
  is not defined since HPUX had a broken <stdarg.h> - TD
* changed OMIT_SCN_KEEPING ifdef to 0 (inactive) in LYCurses.c and in HTML.c,
  still enabling the Style_className:HTML.c keeping and making lynx with lss
  slightly slower than it could be (though faster then dev21).  If somebody
  wishes to fix a bug, here is a description:  If contents of some tag that has
  corresponding color style occupies more than 2 screens, after navigating to
  the page, on which the content of that block starts, and then pressing PGDN
  PGDN PGUP, the effect (color style) of that tag will be lost.  The same
  (loosing style) happens when jumping to the anchor that is in such block and
  is located not on the 1st page.  IMO this is something with style stack.  If
  this will be fixed, then keeping of Style_className:HTML.c can be omitted
  again -VH
* fixed the bug in lynx with lss support -when displaying html pieces such as
  <b> A <b> B </b> C </b>, only 'AB' was drawn in style corresponding to <b>
  -VH
* added HTML source syntax highlighting (when option -prettysrc that is added
  is given to lynx). It's available for lynx compiled with and without lss
  support (it can be much more beautiful when compiled with lss support - read
  lynx.cfg for description). The code is ifdef'ed with USE_PSRC.
  This functionality coexists with old source view and with -preparsed logic
  (ie different commandline options make source view logic different) -VH
* HTChunkPutc was inlined in SGML.c for better performance -VH
* keeping of Style_className was omitted in HTML.c to increase performance of
  lynx compiled with lss support. -VH
* performance of lynx compiled with lss support is increased ~ by 15-20% for
  normal documents, and by up to 50% for documents with a lot of tags VH
* fixed bug in lynx compiled with lss support  that caused it to load local CSS
  stylesheets - lynx didn't understand their syntax so it was exiting VH
* added type information for attributes in HTMLDTD.c (it's used in source
  syntax highlighting mode) VH
* sample .lss files are updated to support source syntax highlighting VH
1999-03-30 (2.8.2dev.21)
* disable LYatexit if memory-leak testing is not configured.
* fixes for unhighlighting problems with color-style support (Vlad Harchev)
* remove '(default: on)' and '(default: off)' strings from configure script
  help message (much lynx-dev discussion) - TD
* remove outdated link to the WebTechs HTML Validation Service from help menu
  and change link to more suitable location for rfc1945 - PW
* correct logic of --disable-full-paths configure option (reported by Georg
  Schwarz) - TD
* fix problems building on OpenVMS with DECC 6.2 (reported by Andy Harper
  <Andy.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>)
  + remove 'DEBUG' definition from build scripts since it is defined in
    the source code.
  + turn off code that tries to use getpwuid(), by defining NOUSERS, since
    those functions are not present on VMS.
  + provide a dummy location for h_errno for systems without that symbol.
  + correct string syntax in VMSexit function
  + ifdef'd use of lynx_version_putenv_command in LYMain.c
  + correct spurious parenthesis in mailform function
  + correct missing COPY_PATH definition for LYUtils.c
* check for 'z' user interrupt in HTLoadHTTP before setting up the output
  stream.  This avoids doing unnecessary work, including possible creation of a
  new HText structure that most likely is never displayed but still pushes
  another document out of the.  cache.  Most commonly this occurs when a HTTP
  error response is received and the user presses 'z' while the resulting alert
  message is shown - KW
* fix of HTUnEscapeSome in HTParse.c for non-ASCII - KW, PG
* tidy up around ed_offset initialization in GridText.c - KED
  (the patch as given did not compile on a non-ANSI compiler because it used
  aggregate initialization - TD)
* add samples/mild-colors.lss (Vlad Harchev)
* add samples/blue-background.lss (from Sergey Svishchev <svs@ropnet.ru>)
* documentation updates for INSTALLATION and PROBLEMS - PW
* use HTConfirm and HTConfirmDefault to gettext'ify CONFIRM_BOOKMARK_DELETE,
  CONFIRM_COMMENT, CONFIRM_LONG_PAGE_PRINT, CONFIRM_LONG_SCREEN_PRINT,
  CONFIRM_MAIL_SOURCE_PREPARSED, CONFIRM_MAIN_SCREEN, FILE_EXISTS_HPROMPT,
  FILE_EXISTS_OPROMPT, NO_OWNER_USE, PREV_DOC_QUERY, REALLY_EXIT_N,
  REALLY_EXIT_Y, REALLY_QUIT_N, REALLY_QUIT_Y (based on report by LP) - TD
* at LYNXCFG:/ page, add links for every included configuration file so we can
  read and edit them (no, currently the changes will be active the next session
  only.  Minor reorganization of LYMain.c done, more required) - LP
* correct test/spaces.html - it should not be in a <PRE> mode by default - LP
* undo recent &emsp; changes so it is a single space as before (suggested by
  KW) - LP
* add ETag anchor element (currently not used, only for information) - LP
* assign LYNXCFG:/ and LYNXCOMPILEOPTS:/ for internal pages of parsed lynx.cfg
  and compile-time info.  Now we will not see a temp file link name in a
  statusline in advanced mode, also kill overhead since pages created only when
  really accessed - LP
* form-based options menu:  the bug described in 1999-03-17 changes now finally
  fixed - LP
* fix expanding entities for x-transparent display charset
  (was broken from 1999-03-04 changes) - LP
* trimmed trailing blanks from *.tbl, fixed chrtrans/def7_uni.tbl and
  chrtrans/viscii_uni.tbl, ensure that it produces correct result - TD
* chrtrans/def7_uni.tbl - entries with trailing spaces now explicitly enclosed
  in quotes to avoid problems with integrating the patches sent by e-mail,
  more comments added - LP

1999-03-17 (2.8.2dev.20)
* protect a couple of spaces with quotes in def7_uni.tbl (suggested by KW) - TD
* add ifdef's for NO_RULES to HTAAServ.c - HN
* add configure --disable-news option - JS
* add configure --disable-finger option - JS
* add malloc checks, remove some #includes that don't need to exist, and
  cleanup where somebody decided to waste instructions setting fields to 0 when
  he already memset()ed the whole struct to 0 (John Bley).
* remove obsolete/unmaintained SHORT_NAMES ifdef's (John Bley).
* add/use LYTrimStartfile function (suggested by LP) - TD
* correct missing null-pointer check in add_printer_to_list function (forwarded
  by BJP from Debian bug-reports) - TD
* add notes about $CC variable to INSTALLATION and PROBLEMS - JS, PW
* tweak for TABLE formatting: break line at </TR> end tag (don't wait
  for next <TR> start tag), effective in SortaSGML mode only - KW
* lots of color style changes, only effective if compiled with USE_COLOR_STYLE;
  together they seem to make color styles act much more reliably and
  consistently - KW
  - Moved some extern definitions and declarations.
  - Made extra handling for LINK REL (or TITLE) attributes consistent
    with example lynx.lss file.
  - More complete (and hopefully more consistent) setting of "normal"
    attributes, especially background color, on screen refresh and after
    statusline messages.  Set normal attributes for statusline prompts.
  - Various other small tweaks, mostly to not lose color changes in a
    document and to avoid color leaking.
  - Attributes for highlighting WHEREIS search targets can be controlled
    by setting style for "whereis" in lynx.lss.
  - Allow mono attribute field in lynx.lss to be a combination of several
    attributes separated by '+' characters.
  - Changes of example lynx.lss file: more logical ordering, added some
    comments, document new stuff.  Changed a few styles for demonstration
    purposes or because text was really hard to read.
* apply color styles to HTML source display, using the same methods as
  for displaying the rendered version.  This is done if and only if
  the -preparsed flag is used (and lynx is compiled with -DUSE_COLOR_STYLE,
  of course).  Please remember that the source displayed with -preparsed
  is *not* the same as the original text/html document, it has been
  mangled by lynx (as the name implies) and may itself not be a valid
  HTML document even if the original was - KW
* changed some slightly suspicious casts in HText_endAnchor's casting hell:
  prefer to cast a line's size element to (int), rather than various int
  variables to (unsigned) - KW
* remove some unnecessary use of dynamic buffers where there is no apparent
  benefit for using them, for the sake of performance or to avoid a minor
  memory leak - KW
* stuffed small memory leak (MultipartContentType) - KW
* absorb 'len' parameter into logic of argncmp, so it still achieves its
  purpose of comparing prefixes of options without undue maintenance effort -TD
* retain logic that uses final URL on command-line (request by KW) - TD
* add/use new functions argcmp and argncmp to allow the use of '--' prefix as
  well as '-' for commandline options.  This means that '-localhost' and
  '--localhost' mean the same thing for lynx.  If EXTENDED_OPTION_LOGIC is
  defined then the extended commandline option logic will be used.  It means
  that '--' will be accepted and will be treated as an end of options.
  Anything after it will be treated as URL even if begins with '-' or '--'
  (Vlad Harchev)
* correct some typos in docs and in scripts (Vlad Harchev <hvv@hippo.ru>)
* modify generated sed script to handle special case of alt_edit_help.html,
  which was being rendered in --enable-gzip-help as alt_edit_help.html.gz.gz
  (reported by KED) - TD
* modify lynx_help/help_files.txt to update links to gzip'd versions of
  alt_edit_help.html, environments.html, test_display.html - KED
* tweak for SGML_LITTERAL (sic) parsing, so that the first nonmatching
  character after the beginning of a putative end tag goes through character
  translation - KW
* add some more pieces of info (if available) to '=' page in advanced user
  mode.  Also show mode as "source" instead of "normal" if viewing SOURCE, in
  all user modes - KW
* minor FASTBACKW_LINK / FASTFORW_LINK tweaks - KW
* removed documentation for nonimplemented chargen URLs - KW
* remove num_n256 hack introduced in dev18 UCDomap.* - LP
* forms-based options menu: fix reloading of previous document *only* when
  necessary (was always, since early forms-based options menu days).  Still
  have a bug - while submitting the options menu lynx reload menu again, but
  this is much faster to load small local file twice than fetch previous
  (possible large) document over the net.  - LP
* &mdash; (&#x2014) now display as "--" (popular requests) - LP
* &emsp; are now displayed as two &ensp; (popular requests),
  previous definition of HT_EM_SPACE now renamed to HT_EN_SPACE. - LP
* minor tweaks in postoptions(), new flag added - LP
* minor changes to make this build with SunOS K&R cc - TD
* entities.h:  clean HTML4.0 entities table added, it is #ifdef'ed with
  ENTITIES_HTML40_ONLY (may be useful for page validation), file entities.h
  moved to src/chrtrans directory - LP
* save few KB of static memory by storing unicodes as 'u16' (was 'long') - LP
* trace log toggle now really interruptible - LP

* ifdef'd recent changes to LYPrint.c to build with djgpp - LP
* remove redundant -DDEBUG from djgpp makefiles - LP
* remove nonstandard ISO-9945-2 - LP
* eliminate a duplicate --enable-included-msgs in configure --help, (reported
  by LV) - TD
* redefine LY_BOLD_START_CHAR for EBCDIC platforms to avoid conflict, adjust
  IsSpecialAttrChar() to take this into account - PG
* rewrite LYKeymapCodes with leading commas to avoid accidental/illegal
  use of trailing comma in an enum list - PG
* modify UCdomap.h to avoid gcc-specific construct using cast to struct of

1999-03-04 (2.8.2dev.19)
* forgot to update PRCS when renaming src/chrtrans/iso9945uni.tbl - TD
1999-03-04 (2.8.2dev.18)
* modify configure script to recover if the intl and po directories are
  missing, allow experimentation with --enable-nls --disable-included-msgs
  --without-included-gettext options (request by HN) - TD
* add sanity-check for EBCDIC FixCharacters() in LYMain.c - PG
* ifdef'd the ADDRLIST code with EXP_ADDRLIST_PAGE, making this available as
  a configure script option --enable-addrlist-page - TD
* create a new command called ADDRLIST, which behaves exactly the same as LIST,
  but which *should* always show only the URL's.  Rather than make it a config
  option (which would have taken me quite a bit longer to do), I've bound it to
  the "A" key (that's a capital "A").  Why not "L" you ask?  Because of the "vi
  keys" option, whereby "l" is used for cursor movement, and "L" stays reserved
  for L(ist) - KED
* change the LYK_xxx keymap definitions to an enum, to simplify ifdef's - TD
* add configure options --disable-gopher, to remove GOPHER code, and
  --disable-trace to remove TRACE code - JS
* modify trace log header to always inform us if anonymous restrictions are
  set - LP
* chartrans: old-style declarations of charsets which do not have Unicode
  tables (CJK, x-transparent, also UTF-8) now moved from LYCharSets.c to
  UCdomap.h and now included with UCInit() in UCdomap.c in a standard way - LP
  (Please re-test CJK and UTF-8)
* add configure --enable-libjs option (Lalo Martins <lalo@webcom.com>)
* add checks for some more LINK tags as listed in "6.12 Link types" of the HTML
  4.0 Specification (Masayasu Ishikawa <mimasa@isoternet.org>)
* changed the effect of some LINK tags with REL attribute of a very relative
  character (Up, Next, Prev, ...) on titles as they appear e.g.  on the LIST
  page:  the title of the target HTParentAnchor isn't being set when such a
  LINK tag is parsed, but the relation is now stored as a property of the
  link itself rather than its destination.  The LIST page shows the relation
  as additional info, not superseding a URL or title string obtained
  otherwise - KW
* move commands in top-level makefile.in which clean *.rej and *.orig from
  'distclean' rule to 'maintainer-clean', make distinct from the @SRCDIR_CLEAN@
  substitution which is intended for use with the configure --srcdir option
  (from reports by Glenn E.  Thobe <thobe@lafn.org> and BL) - TD
* correct LYRemoveTemp() to close file before attempting to remove it; else
  the remove fails on some platforms, e.g., DOS/Windows (report by KW) - TD
* improved documentation for the new cookie options, e.g,.
  COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS, in lynx.cfg - BJP
* fix some memory leaks in LYCookie.c - BJP
* modify 123g (and similar movement) commands to allow for relative links,
  e.g., by using a '+' or '-' after the 'g' - LE
* modify help_files.sed to include '$', making regular expressions work for
  HP-UX (Jens Schmalzing <jens@stat.physik.uni-muenchen.de>)
* add a comment to aclocal.m4 to show where patches for autoconf, needed for
  this configure script, can be found - JS
* add toggling trace log on/off in partial mode, when the downloading is still
  in progress - LP
* more consistent docs for debugging of invalidly nested HTML:  important trace
  messages from actions on invalid tags now have '***' prefix such as "SGML:
  ...  ***ignored" (well:  illegal, forced, assumed, etc.), -preparsed mode now
  better documented - LP
* minor code cleanup: remove redundant includes, fill in 0's for some static
  data initialization (John Bley).
* add 'joe' editor, and variants, to list of those editors that are assumed to
  position the file to a given line number using the "+line" command-line
  option - IC
* remove redundant "(y/n)" substrings from LYMessages_en.h - LV
* add new command named GROWTEXTAREA which adds 5 new blank lines to the bottom
  of a TEXTAREA when executed.  It does not have a default binding, so you need
  to add a KEYMAP for it in your lynx.cfg.  The number of lines added is fixed
  by a #define, but 5 seems to be a "reasonable" increment to use - KED
* add new command named INSERTFILE, which (obviously) inserts a file's contents
  into a TEXTAREA, just above the line the cursor is on when invoked (which
  means you cannot insert a file *below* the final existing TEXTAREA line ...
  but see 1) and 3) for easy ways to over- come this limitation).  It too, has
  no default binding, so a KEYMAP entry is also needed for it - KED
* by default, when the cursor is on the last line of a TEXTAREA, if you hit the
  ENTER key, a new line will be added to the TEXTAREA, with the cursor
  positioned on it.  If that should happen at the bottom of the screen, a
  DOWN_HALF scroll operation is (effectively) performed - KED
* ifdef'd this feature (since at least one person objected to this automatic
  behavior when it was discussed awhile back - BL?), for easy disabling (and to
  make adding a ./configure option easier).  The symbol is AUTOGROW is
  #define'd in LYMainLoop.h - KED
* added an ifdef for the code that causes the external editor to be
  invoked "automatically" on the TEXTAREA contents when ^Ve (or whatever
  the EDIT binding is), rather than attempting to invoke it on the .html
  source file.  This should allow adding a ./configure option to control
  this behavior, until we come up with a different binding/mechanism to
  do the job, that we can all agree on.  The symbol AUTOEXTEDIT is also
  #define'd in LYMainLoop.h.   The command EDITTEXTAREA is still available
  for separate KEYMAP binding, per KW's suggestion - KED
* check the range of chars between 0x80 and LYlowest_eightbit[current_char_set]
  for validity against the charset in use.  If such chars are detected in
  edited or inserted data, a "." char is substituted for them, as with normal
  control chars.  (Suggested by LP) - KED
* added KW's LYCloseTempFP bugfix - KED
* add/use function GetFileName(), e.g., by INSERTFILE.  It is fairly general
  purpose, and can be used whenever the name of an existing file needs to be
  input.  It uses the same mechanism for filename expansion and "history" as
  does the PRINT function - KED
* reorganized a lot of the code into subroutines to provide for 1) and 2);
  still need to do a bit more cleanup of some other (nearly) common code - KED
* rename iso9945_uni.tbl to iso9945uni.tbl to accommodate 'make' programs on
  old systems (such as CLIX 3.1) whose suffix rules fail for filenames longer
  than 14 characters - TD
* change VMS WWW build-script to use prefix=all rather than prefix=ansi,
  so that POSIX functions such as 'stat()' are linked properly (reported by
  Morris D Cox <coxmd@appstate.edu>) - TD
* modify configure macro CF_EBCDIC to avoid using #error, since that is not
  recognized by all compilers - TD
* include <sys/types.h> in CF_INET_ADDR macro, to accommodate systems which
  require that to compile test program with the socket.h, other network
  headers - TD
* removed a cast in free_lynx_cfg, on FREE's argument, which caused some
  compilers to report that an rvalue was being modified (reported by PW) - TD
1999-02-16 (2.8.2dev.17)
* modify LYReadCFG.c to avoid duplicating data for cookies - BJP
* modify HTConfirm to use gettext values for yes/no.  Use HTConfirm in a few
  more places, though completing this will require more work - TD
* add note about resolv library to PROBLEMS - PW
* minor clarification about DOS/Windows binaries in README - PW
* modify ./makefile.in so that portions which are commented-out will be done
  without a leading tab, since that confuses the make program on Digital Unix
  3.2 - TD
* Unix: Don't accept HOME variable as valid if it does not begin with
  a slash - KW
* changed HTGetCharacter to be 8-bit clean, it could not distinguish between a
  character value 255 and EOF.  Changes affect several protocols:  nntp,
  gopher, finger, ftp.  Most notably, news articles containing byte value 255
  could not be completely read - KW
* removed a memory leak in HTFTP.c for some directory data, added a few gettext
  calls - KW
* added ability to show file type description in local Unix directory listings:
  new format codes for use in LIST_FORMAT %t, %T, they are not used by default
  - KW
* modify "clean" makefile rule to allow for FreeBSD, which generates core
  files such as lynx.core - KED, TD
* correct sign-extension when converting characters after edit of TEXTAREA
  (upper-128 characters were being translated to dots, reported by IC) - KED
* worked with some pathological/boundary-case pages, and fixed some some edges
  that could fail (eg, last line of document is also last line of a TEXTAREA,
  and lines are being added; page containing *only* a one-line TEXTAREA field;
  etc).  While it was unlikely one would run into such beasts in real life,
  they all work correctly now.  Thanks to Greg Marr and Serge Munhov for
  providing some very basic pages that I was able to easily modify for various
  test cases - KED
* added a few flags to the TextAnchor and HTLine struct's, to indicate an
  expansion line.  These were added to allow for line deletion when a TEXTAREA
  is "reset" or shrinks (when we get around to tackling those tasks) - KED
* the editor's cursor is now positioned on the same line in the edit file, as
  it was on when the editor was invoked (relative to the beginning of the
  TEXTAREA).  At least for those editors that lynx knows support initial
  positioning (emacs, vi, pico, jove, and jed for non-VMS platforms; sedt for
  VMS) - KED
* cleaned up and corrected a few comments; simplified a few small bits of
  code - KED
* added cookie_domain_flags enum to LYCookie.h, usage should be apparent with
  patch applied - BJP
* updated free_lynx_globals() for cookie variables - BJP
* replaced cookie_add_acceptlist, cookie_add_rejectlist and
  cookie_set_invcheck functions with cookie_domain_flag_set - BJP
* saved a bit of memory by dropping useless pointer memory initialization
  (exactly WHAT was I thinking?)  - BJP
* changed LYrcFile.c, LYReadCFG.c to call cookie_domain_flag_set  - BJP
* new lynxkeycode BACKTAB_KEY with value 0x10F.  DO_NOTHING is and shall remain
  0x10E, as documented in lynx.cfg.  Moved MOUSE_KEY out of the way - does it
  need to be in the tables at all?  BACKTAB_KEY will be recognized if the
  (n)curses keypad() input handling returns KEY_BTAB, which happens if the
  terminal description has the right kB or kcbt capability string and the
  terminal actually generates that string (often "^[[Z", generated for
  shift+tab).  May also work with lynx-keymaps mechanism.  Not tested with
  slang, maybe this has to be added to some more of the various tables in
  LYStrings.c - KW
* new user-visible key commands FASTFORW_LINK and FASTBACKW_LINK, with
  lynxactionscodes LYK_FASTFORW_LINK and LYK_FASTBACKW_LINK.  By default mapped
  from <tab> key (^I) and new BACKTAB_KEY, respectively.  Previously <tab> was
  mapped from NEXT_LINK, which has some special handling if the invoking key
  was <tab> (and if FASTTAB was defined in LYMainLoop.c, which was the case by
  default).  The old behavior of <tab> is still available if it is mapped with
  KEYMAP to NEXT_LINK in lynx.cfg - KW
* these commands always go to a previous (or next) link if there is one,
  and skip multiple lines that are part of the same textarea - KW
* recognize the new key actions also during partial file display, for some
  roughly corresponding movement - KW
* new lynxeditactioncode LYE_FORM_PASS, to allow any lynxkeycode to end the
  editing of a form field and be passed up to the caller - it will then
  normally be mapped to a lynxactioncode.  LYE_FORM_PASS keys are generally
  ignored in non-forms line editing.  This is used for BACKTAB_KEY, as well as
  several other keys that were previously handled specially in form_getstr - KW
* extended the maps in LYEditmap.c to cover the same range of lynxkeycodes as
  the LYKeymap.c tables.  Yes, this uses more space, but the tables need to be
  consistent - KW
* map lynxkeycode 0x00 to LYK_DO_NOTHING, as lynx.cfg said all the time - KW
* some tweaks of displayed strings in 'K'ey Map page.  Don't show CHANGE_LINK
  binding if mouse not enabled (it may not be useful even when -use_mouse is
  on) - KW
* function expand_substring used with NCURSES for user-defined mapping keysyms
  to byte sequences was parsing the "^(...)" construct wrong - KW
* other small tweaks in key handling code - KW
* changes to lynx.cfg to better reflect reality. - KW
* terminology note:  lynxkeycode = what's between the colons in lynx.cfg
  KEYMAP:...:..., lynxactioncode = LYK_* code for what's right of the second
  colon, lynxeditactioncode = what's assigned in LYEditmap.c (and which may
  differ between lineedit_mode Default Binding and alternative bindings) - KW
* formatting tweak in HTML.c for <DD> not preceded by <DT>:  Don't use wrong
  indentation in that case - KW
* changes from DK for DOS up to 1999-02-14 - KW
* minor documentation tweaks - LP
* replace most uses of free with FREE (John Bley).
* correct HTEndParam so that if fewer command-parameters are given than
  expected, we still terminate the command properly (reported by
  Michael Warner) - TD
1999-02-08 (2.8.2dev.16)
* minor documentation tweaks for EDITTEXTAREA - LP
* correct uninitialized buffer variable in send_file_to_mail() which caused
  core dump (reported by LV) - KW
* recognize Subject and Message-Id in embedded comments in HTML documents, in
  the form generated by MHonArc for mailing list archives (including lynx-dev).
  Use these to generate a default Subject and an In-Reply-To header (currently
  not for VMS) when replying by mail (sending a 'C'omment, or following a
  mailto link) from such a page.  The old methods to get a title other than the
  fallback (the URL) still are there and have precedence, by in reality seem to
  apply very rarely.  If no suitable comment strings are found or they are
  regarded as invalid (bad characters, not exactly right format) they are not
  used, and the fallback (URL as Subject, no In-Reply-To) applies - KW
* use the Message-Id of a news article to generate a References header when
  posting a reply.  Lynx's new article listing doesn't understand threading,
  but this is nicer for other newsreader that do.  The References header of the
  referenced article is not used, so there will be only one message-id in the
  generated References header, but this is better than nothing.  The article's
  message-id is appended as a parameter to the URL of the generated newsreply
  link, in the form ";ref=...", so this extends the syntax of Lynx's newsreply:
  URL scheme.  Nothing should have changed for snews:  and other s-versions of
  the various URL schemes for news access - KW
* Message-Id and Subject of a news article are also made available for replying
  by mail - KW
* LYNews.c: Don't post a message that is empty or has only '>'-quoted text - KW
* HTNews.c:  got rid of some suspicious fixed length buffers.  Fixed minor
  memory leaks.  Added abort of the target stream which was missing in some
  cases.  Create mailto:  hrefs in URL-escaped form if necessary, they will be
  unescaped in LYMail.c.  (News URLs still don't use escaping the right way,
  especially for message-ids.) Recognize special meaning of "Followup-to:
  poster" (don't treat "poster" as a newsgroup name).  Other small tweaks - KW
* add samples/cernrules.txt - KW
* except for DJGPP, move lookup code for domain names (not dotted-quad IP
  addresses) from HTParseInet into a new function:  LYGetHostByName acts like
  the normal gethostbyname, but includes the NSL_FORK logic.  Interruption is
  indicated in global variable lynx_nsl_status - KW
* use LYGetHostByName instead of HTParseInet for URL guessing - KW
* select on tty file descriptor in NSL_FORK loop also if compiled with slang.
  This should make 'z' during lookup more responsive - KW
* don't compile in the rules implementation code if NO_RULES is defined
  (suggested by BL) - KW
* fix special case of EDITTEXTAREA where the returned file is empty - BJP
* write to .lynxrc values for COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAIN
  when options screen is used - BJP
* add lynx.cfg and .lynxrc support for a few new options:
    COOKIE_STRICT_INVALID_DOMAINS,
    COOKIE_LOOSE_INVALID_DOMAINS,
    COOKIE_QUERY_INVALID_DOMAINS
  They're the same sort as COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS, comma-delimited lists - BJP
* modify LYOpenTemp() to report unusual errors, i.e., other than if the
  temporary file could not be created because it already exists - PG
* more fixes to CF_INET_ADDR - TD
* modify README to indicate where win32 binaries are found - JS
* add chrtrans tables for Ukrainian Cyrillic: koi8-u, cp866u, iso-9945-2
  (patch by Serhii Hlodin <hlodin@lutsk.bank.gov.ua>)
* patch for TEXTAREA edit feature - KED
  1. Handles the renumbering of link number tags [nnn], when the tag itself is
     split across two lines (see below).
  2. Scrolling down, going to the bottom of the document, etc, now work
     properly, when the TEXTAREA is expanded beyond the bottom of the
     (original) screen display.
  3. Hitting the reset button is now handled properly WRT the "old" text in
     expansion lines (now *always* empty).
  4. Attempting to edit (^Ve) a TEXT field (not a TEXTAREA), is now blocked,
     with the user getting an error msg.
  5. The function call now returns the number of lines that the cursor should
     be moved from its current position, to end up on the first blank line of
     any trailing empty lines in the TEXTAREA (there will always be one).
* bug fixes for TEXTAREA edit feature - KED
  1. Thanks to a suggestion by Bela, your regular EDIT keybinding ("e" by
     default), will now bring up the editor within a TEXTAREA, so there's no
     need to "waste" a separate keybinding (though you can still additionally
     bind the function separately, if desired).
  2.  Converts any tab chars in the edited file, to spaces in the TEXTAREA
     anchor line.  The tabstop is currently #define'd to the quasi-standard
     value of 8.  (If anyone thinks that needs to be user configurable, feel
     free to add that to the o(ptions) form/menu,
     cmd-line-arg/lynx.cfg/.lynxrc/userdefs.h, whatever ...
     I recommend against doing so though, as tabstops that are not set at 8,
     are a PITA to deal with, generally speaking.  I dunno if tab chars in a
     TEXTAREA form are prohibited "by spec", or if it is just a "lynxism" that
     they cause rendering problems (as well as downstream problems with
     submit/etc, I think), but I felt I needed to do something to make lynx
     behave rationally if they are present in the edited data (quite possibly
     from an arbitrary file that one pulled into the editor).  Filtering them
     to spaces, seemed the most reasonable thing to do.
  3. Replaces any embedded control chars with something printable (I chose a
     "." char, since it is less "intrusive" than some other choices, like "*",
     "+", "#", etc).  As with tabs, when some of these chars *are* rendered
     into the TEXTAREA, strange things may happen.  This shouldn't be much of a
     limitation, since many of these chars perform line-editing or
     system/job-control functions, when entered directly while one is in the
     TEXTAREA.  They currently cannot be "escaped" and entered as actual text
     chars, so far as I can tell.  Anyway ...  I don't know of any "legitimate"
     reason for them to be used as TEXTAREA data, so for now, you get "dots" in
     their place.
  4. Cleans up a few comments, and such.
* update some linked in lynx_help_main.html (Heikki Kantola <hezu@iki.fi>)
* add checks for null return from malloc to HTInit.c, LYMain.c, LYReadCFG.c,
  LYUtils.c (patch by John Bley)
* add telnet, tn3270 and rlogin program paths to configure script
  (patch by George.Lindholm@ubc.ca).
1999-01-28 (2.8.2dev.15)
* correct calls to HTAddParam() in LYDownLoad.c to handle optional second
  parameter (reported by KW) - TD
* change HTAddXpand() to assume its parameter (an environment variable) is
  already expanded and simply is not quoted (reported by Ryan Hung
  <rhung@vcn.bc.ca>) - TD
* add configure --disable-included-msgs option to allow suppressing of bundled
  ./po directory for the NLS message library contents.  If no ./po directory
  is found, the configure script assumes it is preinstalled anyway (request
  by HN) - TD
* add pattern to script which customizes pathnames in lynx.cfg to support
    GLOBAL_MAILCAP:/PATH_TO/lynx_doc/samples/mailcap
  (request by PG) - TD
* export $PATH when calling cfg_defs.sh - PG
* add a simple test to check if the temporary directory is actually writable
  if we cannot create a temporary file in LYOpenTemp (reported by PG) - TD
* miscellaneous DOS/DJGPP compile/build fixes - LP
* enabled CERN-style rules, there are two new lynx.cfg options, RULESFILE and
  RULE.  No example file or documentation yet beyond comments in lynx.cfg.  The
  rules mechanism itself is unchanged from what was present for a long time
  (but never used), except for some memory cleanup.  Use -DNO_RULES at compile
  time to disable - KW
* add changes to invoke external editor on textarea, can be invoked by adding a
  KEYMAP entry for EDITTEXTAREA area to lynx.cfg (originally from
  aldomel@ix.netcom.com, but much rework) - KED
* use HTSprintf0 in HTTCP.c - TD
* added PARSE_STRICTPATH and PARSE_QUERY to interface of HTParse(), for
  requesting only the relevant part of what is returned for PARSE_PATH.  This
  isn't yet used anywhere - KW
* changes to StrAllocVsprintf() to take width and precision in most format
  specifications into account, and to correct the memory allocation logic.
  This was tested by setting GROW_SIZE to a small value of 8, so far no
  crashes, but it is certainly not right for all possible formats, especially
  involving floating point conversions - KW
* changed HTSprintf0() to pass a string already existing in its output buffer
  on, this should save a few realloc's in StrAllocVsprintf() - KW
* changes to code handling LIST_FORMAT to avoid some unnecessary reallocations,
  to recognize some more format flags, and to treat invalid formats somewhat
  better - KW
* corrected recent HTFile.c change for systems without S_ISVTX - KW
* added memory cleanup for uid/gid cache functions in HTAAProt.c - KW
* increased ATEXITSIZE to 40 - KW
* added TRACE output to HTAnchor.c's free_adult_table.  If this shows anything
  at program exit (if TRACE is on then), it means that HTAnchor structures have
  been missed by the normal automatic cleanup (walking the history list and
  following links) - KW
* changed more status codes in HTUtils.h to libwww5-like values - KW
* added new function to check for a valid Internet hostname - KW
  Use it before actually trying to resolve an address, it should
  a. avoid the overhead of NSL_FORK if it would fail anyway,
  b. prevent DNS queries for invalid names, which may unnecessarily
     consume time, bandwidth, and DNS server cache memory, and
     may confuse some resolver libraries and servers,
  c. speed up address guessing sometimes if something was mistyped,
  d. thwart some attempts to crash Lynx with invalid URLs.
* this time really make "Alert" statusline prefix localizable - KW
* new function HTAlwaysAlert(), which can be called even when LYCursesON isn't
  true and should always produce a visible message - KW
* use new valid_hostname to also check telnet, tn3270, and rlogin hostnames
  before calling the external program (after most invalid character have
  already been stripped).  Added a fflush(stdout) to make sure messages are
  visible before external program is called - KW
* made changes equivalent to the 1998-12-31 HTSACopy and HTSACat modification
  to the LY_FIND_LEAKS versions of those functions.  Having source and target
  string for StrAllocCopy or StrAllocCat overlap (or being equal) should be
  considered a programming error, but at least one place in LYEdit.c currently
  seems to do it and rely on the new behavior.  (Editing current file sometimes
  didn't work with LY_FIND_LEAKS) - KW
* closed memory leaks in LYKeymap.c, provided for memory cleanup at exit of
  LYCgi.c environment strings - KW
* explicitly put HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE and HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET strings into
  lynxcgi environment only if they are non-empty, i.e., set to something in
  lynx.cfg or the personal configuration or Options screen.  This makes the
  environment a lynxcgi scripts sees resemble more closely that of a remote CGI
  script handling a request from Lynx with the same configuration - HTTP.c also
  only sends Accept-{Language,Charset} headers if preferred language and
  preferred charset (respectively) have been set to non-empty strings.
  (Strictly speaking, an empty Accept-* header has a different meaning from a
  non-existing one, but it doesn't make much sense to generate empty Accept-*
  headers, since they mean "nothing is accepted".) There are other differences
  in the lynxcgi environment (e.g.  HTTP_ACCEPT isn't set, ",iso-8859-1;q=0.01"
  etc.  isn't appended to HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET, apart from missing
  redirections), but apparently nobody has needed a more exact CGI emulation
  for real scripts - KW
* removed sending of "Negotiate: trans" in HTTP.c since it violates transparent
  content negotiation specs, added comments - KW
* correct error handling in CF_INET_ADDR, which did not restore $LIBS when no
  applicable library was found for inet_addr (reported by IC) - TD
* correction to CF_TERMCAP_LIBS, which used inconsistent spelling for the cache
  variable, so predefined termcap/terminfo library was not necessarily
  detected - TD
* resolved autoconf 2.13 problem, resync configure script with patched
  autoconf 2.13 - TD
1999-01-18 (2.8.2dev.14)
* use HTSprint0 in LYCurses.c, LYForms.c, LYGetFile.c, LYJump.c - TD
* modify LYCheckMail so it does not continue to report new mail when the mail
  file's modification time differs from its access time (reported by LV) - TD
* add check for inet_addr function, and (preferred) inet_aton.  The first
  function is reported to be sometimes in -lresolv, or -lbind when it is not
  present in the conventional network libraries (from report by
  mattack@area.com and comments by HN) - TD
* resync config.sub, config.guess with autoconf 2.13.19990117 (not yet
  configure, since autoconf 2.13 contains some new bugs) - TD
* modified handling of untranslatable charsets, after noticing that a page
  with charset=ISO-2022-JP produced an alert message with a truncated
  "iso-2022-j".  Looking more closely, the code could also result in memory
  corruption in some cases.  Compared with older versions, then changed the
  code to something somewhat like what was intended there.  But we don't have
  an "Other ISO Latin" display character set any more; maybe those `else'
  blocks should just have disappeared completely - KW
* minor changes to SortaSGML DTD for PARAM, THEAD - KW
* make "Alert" statusline prefix localizable - KW
* extend fixtext.sh to also change continued lines - KW
* changed LYCheckForProxyURL to act more like it appears to have been indented,
  and clarify comment.  Minor change in is_url - KW
* prevent removal of hidden link number from bookmark document in a very
  obscure case of a bookmarked ISMAP link - KW
* HText_SubmitForm:  make sure query is always allocated, even if the set of
  form fields to be sent turned out to be empty - KW
* some comments corrected in HTML.c, LYCharSets.c - KW
* tweak in curses_w_style for display without color - KW
* remove minor memory leak in LYDownload.c - KW
* changed error handling in LYTraversal.c to make sure terminal gets restored
  to sane mode before showing error message and exiting - KW
* increased VALUE_SIZE for buffer in HTMIME.c from 1024 to 5120.  Someone
  needed increase for long Set-Cookie headers - KW
* two new functions in HTList.c to reverse and to combine lists - KW
* Lynx was using the wrong precedence for entries within a mailcap (relative to
  other entries from the same file):  RFC 1524 says "The configuration
  information will be obtained from the FIRST matching entry in a mailcap
  file[...]", but Lynx effectively gave precedence to the last match.  Recent
  Debian packages of lynx have had a patch applied to change this, but that
  patch also seems to affect the precedence order relative to viewers defined
  in other places, i.e., lynx.cfg and HTInit.c.  The patch here instead changes
  the precedence of mailcap entries form the same files to RFC-like behavior,
  by reordering the list generated from a mailcap file after we have finished
  reading it in.  It leaves the order relative to viewers from other sources
  unchanged.  Maybe it should be made configurable whether Lynx's traditional
  precedence or the new one is used; currently there is just a #define in
  HTInit.c which could be changed to revert to traditional behavior - KW
* add checks for null return from malloc to LYCurses.c, LYStrings.c,
  (patch by John Bley)
* add support for HP Roman8 as a display character set.  HP Roman8 is used by
  Hewlett-Packard terminals and hpterm, HP's version of xterm.  The character
  repertoire is largely similar to ISO Latin 1 but the code points are all
  mixed up (patch by Christian Weisgerber)
* modify WWW/Library/Implementation/HTAAUtil.c::HTAA_setupReader():  to use
  malloc'd buffer rather than static buffer, to avoid overflow (patch by Thomas
  Braun <Thomas.Braun@link-up.de>)
* modifications to allow building the DOS lynx port with support of gettext for
  producing messages in various languages.  The DOS port of the gettext package
  still needs minor tweaking to get it to function properly, but this shouldn't
  be a problem for most people trying to compile lynx for DOS themselves.
  Rather than put yet more DOS-specific makefiles in the distribution, I put
  the changes to the makefiles within comments, which can easily be removed to
  enable the changes - DK
* add a comment about LYUCcharset struct "UChndl" field.  Tweak trace
  messages - LP
* fix parsing of ALT=value attribute when the value is not quoted.  When the
  first character is not us-ascii it was corrupted by chartrans in all versions
  of lynx.  Fix case S_equals in SGML_character() - LP
* chartrans:  ignore RAW_TOGGLE key and do not change LYUseDefaultRawMode if
  current document's charset specified explicitly, add status message.  (Let
  user switch toggle only when necessary, to avoid future problems :-) - LP
* chartrans: change the default value of PREPEND_CHARSET_TO_SOURCE in lynx.cfg
  from FALSE to TRUE (better safe than sorry) - LP
* reorder forms-based options menu (cosmetic):  rename "HTML error tolerance"
  to "HTML error recovery", reorganize "Character Set Options" section -
  "Display character set" went to "Personal preferences" section, "Assume
  character set" and "Raw 8-bit or CJK mode" went to "Document Layout" section;
  "Execution Links" went to "File management" section.  (Hope this helps to
  reduce confusion) - LP
* remove "environment variables" section from INSTALLATION, change references
  to Lynx User Guide in all docs.  Minor tweaks on help files - LP
* add a comment to mime.types and lynx.cfg on SUFFIX definition:  "This has an
  effect for ftp and local files only, http server does specify MIME type in
  the Content-Type header" - LP
1999-01-13 (2.8.2dev.13)
* correct a missing trailing newline in caselower.h (this may be a problem
  patching since 'diff' does not like that) - TD
* fix off-by-one alignment download options (reported by LV) - IC
* use HTSprintf/HTSprintf0 in UCAuto.c - TD
* remove stop/start curses calls around UCChangeTerminalCodepage() in
  GridText.c, since they are not necessary, and are a little distracting
  when running Lynx in xterm - TD
* correct handling in getfile() of ~/ expansion - KW
* modify NSL_FORK logic to prevent child process from running any signal
  handlers the parent may have installed - KW
* the logic added to display_page for avoiding unnecessary screen redraw with
  partial display (see 1998-12-03) is now disabled if enable_scrollback is set.
  Otherwise displayed pages could appear as empty (or with only the current
  link drawn) - KW
* modify conditions under which screen style cache is reset (only relevant for
  color style in combination with partial display) - KW
* update the INSTALLATION file, reflecting the changes between the two DJGPP
  versions of GCC in use.  Also, change optimization to -O2 in the other two
  DOS makefiles - DK
* add support for ISO 8859-15, i.e., "Latin 9", make corrections to DEC
  Multinational character translations (patch by (Christian Weisgerber
  <naddy@mips.rhein-neckar.de>)
* modify po/makefile.inn to use mkdirs.sh rather than mkinstalldirs script
  (reported by LV) - TD
* modify print_help_and_exit() to print values for the simple options, i.e.,
  toggle, integer and string, as part of "lynx -help" (request by
  mattack@area.com) - TD
* correct sense shown for Old_DTD variable in LYOptions.c (reported by DK).
* correct order of params for non-Unix use of HTAddParam in LYBookmark.c
  (reported by DK)
1998-12-31
* delete unused 'PREVAIL' color-style code from HTML.c, merge a couple of
  sections of logic with TrimColorClass, and change Style_className to
  a dynamically-allocated string - TD
* modify fmt_tempname() to check for buffer overflow - TD
* check/modify for potential buffer overflows:  HTAlert.c, LYBookMark.c,
  LYKeymap.c, LYPrint.c (including splitting it up into functions) - TD
* change GetOptValues to return status separately from the decoded value, in
  case the options form is damaged (suggested by LP) - TD
* add new function HTAddXpand to use in special case where Lynx is building
  shell command using data from user's configuration, which should not be
  quoted.  Use this in LYEdit.c to allow $EDITOR to be given as the editor
  name (request by PG) - TD
* add new function LYOpenTraceLog, to combine logic in LYMain.c and
  LYMainLoop.c, including Lynx's version message - TD
* fix some discrepancies between the code and the documentation (help files),
  for the alternate line edit keybindings, that were first included in the
  distribution somewhere around -dev.3, or so - KED
* added a delete-to-beginning-of-line (for the alt bindings only), and a help
  page that describes the alternate bindings - KED
* improved description of "HTML error tolerance" - KW
* changes for handling lynxcgi:  handle failure of execve(), by showing the
  system error and then _exit()ing the child process.  Make sure REQUEST_METHOD
  is always set.  Added checks for EINTR and other errors from read() - KW
* DOSPATH or EMX:  remove strange code dealing with root of local drive from
  is_url() and HTDOS_name()/HTDOS_wwwname(), add right code at the earlier
  stage in LYFillLocalFileURL() - LP (thanks KW)
* relax warning from HTAlert to HTUserMsg on REFRESH_URL_NOT_ABSOLUTE - LP
* more tweaks on transfer rate calculation - LP
* modify HTSACopy and HTSACat in case the source and destination are the same
  pointer - TD
* tested/removed redundant OS/2 EMX adjustment to filename from LYEdit.c - TD
* optimized LYEdit.c by moving calls on HTSYS_name(filename) to a single place
  near the top - LP
* forms-based options menu:  prevent spoofing attempts from possible overruns
  (e.g., user can doing 'e'dit in 'o'ptions and get core dump if
  display_char_set gets an illegal number such as 50, or hang the keyboard with
  illegal Line edit style) - LP
* forms-based options menu:  add new logical section - Document Layout,
  currently with "HTML error tolerance" (TagSoup/SortaSGML), "Pop-up for select
  fields", "Show images" (no_alt/labels/links) and "Verbose images".  New
  switches added for information purposes mostly, they duplicate hot keys but
  not so hidden from user's view.  Documentation updated also.  (Oh yes, "Line
  edit style" option is now available when we have a real choice >1) - LP
* split cfg_defs.sh into two script based on revised script from PG - TD
* minor fixes for top-level makefile.in - PG
* fixes for makefiles with gcc 2.8.1 using DJGPP 2.02 (do not use "-c -o"
  combination, strip trailing blanks from makefile.sla, change optimization
  level to -O2) - DK
* rename New_DTD variable to Old_DTD, change logic for -tagsoup option to be
  consistent with sense in lynx.cfg (reported by LP)
1998-12-26 (2.8.2dev.12)
* use HTSprintf0 in LYCgi.c - TD
* add tab-completion on URL's, by using previously-entered strings for
  matching (patch by Kari Davidsson <karid@isholf.is>) - TD
* add version number to trace log (patch by IC)
* modify HTDOS_name to be consistent with HTVMS_name, which does not modify
  its parameter (reported by LP).  Also, modify HTDOS_name and HTDOS_wwwName
  so they allocate space for the result rather than using a static buffer - TD
* modify LYEdit.c to use HTAddParam - TD
* make HREF/NAME for "Environment" consistent in Lynx_users_guide.html
  (reported by LP)
* correct DOS/EMX logic in LYEdit.c which incremented 'filename' pointer when
  its length was greater than 1 rather than recopying the string, causing a
  core dump when 'filename' was freed (reported by LP, this applies to
  2.8.1rel.2) - TD
* correct sense of 'already_exists()' function from dev.11, which caused
  various file-menu operations to stop working (reported by IC) - TD
1998-12-24 (2.8.2dev.11)
* use HTSprintf/HTSprintf0 in about half of the WWW library files where
  applicable:  HTAABrow.c HTAAServ.c HTAAUtil.c HTAccess.c HTAnchor.c HTDOS.c
  HTFTP.c HTFWriter.c HTFile.c HTFinger.c HTFormat.c HTGopher.c - TD
* eliminate most duplicate gettext parameters, reduced the number of files
  listed in po/POTFILES.in to a size that may allow build with the Solaris
  xgettext utility - TD
* correct rule for remaking po/makefile - TD
* workaround for HPUX sed program, providing '$' anchors for ".*" expressions,
  which is redundant, but should be harmless (suggested by Jean-Yves Levesque
  <Jean-Yves.Levesque.jyves@nortelnetworks.com>)
* add new help file, keystrokes/environments.html - LP
* fix HTReadProgress():  more accurate transfer rate calculation - LP
* update slang makefile.dos, and corresponding INSTALLATION notes - DK
* correct my integration of IZ's LY_CHANGE_LINK code, which resulted in an
  out-of-bounds index into revmap (reported by LP, LV) - TD
* add note about sendmail for Win32 to lynx.cfg - JS
* add note for successful build on NeXT to INSTALLATION (Christian Jensen
  <cejensen@winternet.com>)
* add checks for null return from malloc to HTInit.c, LYMainLoop.c, LYUtils.c,
  (patch by John Bley <jbb6@acpub.duke.edu>)
* remove reference to 'persistent_cookies' in LYCookie.c which prevented
  compile when persistent cookies configure option was disabled (report
  by PG) - KW
* move assignment to SHELL back from WWW/Library/makefile.in to CommonMakefile,
  and revert use of $CONFIG_SHELL in configure script, since this appears to
  stop auto-configure from finding working include feature of 'make' on CLIX
  (reported by Alex Matulich) - TD
1998-12-16 (2.8.2dev.10)
* FROM_FILE is not used any more for a domain (although it is currently still
  defined.  Renamed COOKIE_FLAG_PERSISTENT to COOKIE_FLAG_FROM_FILE.  Don't
  change a domain's "behavior" (ACCEPT_ALWAYS, REJECT_ALWAYS, or QUERY_USER)
  just because there was a persistent cookie for it.  Users who want to always
  accept cookies from a domain without prompting should use
  COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS - KW
* FREE domain_entry objects when they are not used any more.  Other minor leak
  removed - KW
* some (few) changes for draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-10.txt.  Don't accept
  invalid port lists (this may need more tweaking).  Added some comments - KW
* try to preserve cookies (within a domain) in the same order in which they
  were received, although this is probably not necessary after all.  There is
  no difference any more w.r.t.  insertion into the list between cookies from
  the file and cookies from response headers - KW
* use <= instead of < comparison when checking whether a cookie has expired -KW
* don't write expired cookies, cookies with discard attribute, or cookies
  without expiration date to persistent file - KW
* don't call HTConfirmCookie for cookies read from file.  This doesn't change
  the logic since previously HTConfirmCookie allowed all file cookies anyway -
  KW
* don't delete the domain_list if it becomes empty.  Doing this could result in
  unnecessary multiple atexit()'s - KW
* write the cookie file even if we now have no cookies, if we have previously
  read cookies from the file.  The file should be updated if all cookies that
  were in it are expired or superseded or deleted - KW
* when reading file cookies, set attributes in a way that (hopefully) makes
  more sense than just ignoring them.  See comments in LYLoadCookies.
  We are restricted a lot by the choice of a Netscape-compatible cookie file
  format, some version 1 properties just cannot be stored in it AFAIK.  Some
  more tweaking in LYLoadCookies - KW
* setting a domains behavior to accept "A)lways" didn't actually work, it had
  the same effect as "P)rompt".  Corrected this simple (probably cut-and-paste)
  error - KW
* some changes in what is displayed on Cookie Jar page:  FROM_FILE is a
  property of individual cookies, not of domains as previously.  Cookies from
  file (which haven't been updated) are shown as "(from a previous session)".
  Show expiration time ("Max.  Gobble Date") whenever we have one.  The state
  of the "discard" attribute is already displayed separately - KW
* made color styles code work much better with TagSoup parsing mode.  A new
  flag bit is set for some tags in HTMLDTD which indicates that, even though
  they may be otherwise handled as SGML_EMPTY, this emptiness is fake.  This
  can only work reasonably for elements that require an end tag (not for LI,
  for example) - KW
* added SUMMARY attribute for TABLE element to HTMLDTD (but we don't do
  anything with it) - KW
* split_line:  Try to account for changes in anchor position and extent in all
  possible cases.  This improves some cases where the selectable text could
  become too short and, in extreme cases, a link could become erroneously
  "hidden" - KW
* split_line:  color style changes after the split position are moved to the
  correct position in the new line - KW
* set TextAnchor's line_num in HText_beginInput, so that split_line can adjust
  the input field's position properly if a split moves it to the next line.
  Should solve problem reported for www.lycos.com - KW
* don't refuse to read from file-descriptor 0 in HTDoRead for Unix if it is not
  a tty.  The socket fd from HTDoConnect can be 0 if fd 0 was not open when
  lynx was started non-interactively - KW
* increase INIT_LINE_SIZE in HTTP.c slightly from 1024 to 1536, so that for a
  typical ethernet MTU the first packet of a response can more often be read in
  with a single read() - KW
* add a missing FREE() in HTTP.c - KW
* use case mapping from ftp.unicode.org /Public/UNIDATA for case-insensitive
  user search (thanks "Kari E.  Hurtta" <Kari.Hurtta@ozone.FMI.FI>), new file
  src/chrtrans/caselower.h added.  This is used instead of UPPER8 assumption
  introduced in 2.8 release (see 1998-02-27).  There is no difference in speed
  though - LP
* fix links in History/Visited Links page for documents with blank
  <TITLE></TITLE>, also remove leading spaces from titles to make output a
  little better - LP
* use djgpp's <sys/config.h> file, which contains default values for autoconf
  style definitions - LP
* updated lynx.man, lynx.hlp for "SEE ALSO" sections - KED, JS
* optimize the test commands specified in the mailcap file by remembering which
  tests have been run already.  (patch by Marc Huber <marc@sixpack.de>)
* add lint rule to makefile.in, as well as corresponding rule in WWW/... - LV
* update version in makefile.in to 2-8-2 - PG
* fix makefiles to build with DJGPP (problem introduced in dev8) - LP
* use new symbol KEYMAP_SIZE to get rid of various constants relating to the
  size of keymap[] array, e.g, 0x293, 659 - TD
* add new mouse and keymap functionality to lynx:
  a) If one clicks mouse *near* a link, the "point/focus" is moved to this link
     (without actual activation);
  b) One can bind keys with ordinals larger than DO_NOTHING;
  c) Primitive context sensitive menu added to the middle button of a mouse
     (currently ncurses only);
  Current micro-problem with "c" is that I do not know how to refresh a screen
  before triggering the action, so if the action chosen from the menu would
  not redraw the screen, the menu outline is left on the screen - IZ
* modify LYKeymap.c so that it can show internal keymaps above 0400 as
  hexadecimal codes even if they do not appear in the function-key table - IZ
* add HTOptParam to avoid spurious quoting of blanks in rlogin URLs by
  HTAddParam - TD
* correct missing assignment in remote_session(), from dev.9 changes for
  HTAddParam, which broke telnet/rlogin URLs (reported by IC) - TD
1998-12-12 (2.8.2dev.9)
* change location-not-absolute message from an alert to user-message - TD
* check for EINTR from read() call in HTDoRead, and retry if necessary.  This
  change only for Unix.  Interrupted read() system calls should be rare (or
  impossible, depending on the system implementation?) since the read() is only
  done after a successful select(), but checking can't hurt - KW
* check for read read() errors in HTDoRead and HTCopy, and generate alert
  messages for unexpected errors.  HTCopy still returns HT_LOADED to indicate
  success if any data have been received before an unexpected error or
  disconnection.  Previously this happened without any indication to the user
  that something was wrong and a document or file might be incomplete.  These
  changes currently only for Unix - KW
* added/enhanced comments in HTFormat.c to document current behavior of HTCopy,
  HTFileCopy, HTGzFileCopy, HTParseSocket, HTParseFile, and HTParseGzFile - KW
* moved definition of HT_NO_DATA to HTUtils.h, changed value of some status
  codes to libwww5-like values while we're at it - KW
* correct uninitialized de variable in LYCookie.c when dump_output_immediately
  is set.  Also, made a slight change to this mode in LYMain.c, so that cookies
  received will also be written to the cookie file; cleanup() is not called in
  -dump mode (reported by Elwin Oost) - BJP
* correct include-path for chrtrans makefile to allow builds outside the
  source tree (Masashi Fujita)
* minor cleanup of LYCookie.c, add some traces - BJP
* add support for content encoding for x-bzip2, bzip2 for suffix "bz2" - HN
* add po directory to install-bin and uninstall rules - TD
* modify the environment variable logic to avoid freeing string given to putenv
  until after giving it a new string - TD
* add several environment variables to LYPrint.c - KED
* add ENVIRONMENT section to lynx.man and lynx.hlp - KED
* add installation note about --enable-gzip-help - KED
* update installation notes for WAIS - DK
* add/use new functions for building up command-string for shell commands,
  which quote parameters as needed:  HTAddParam(), HTEndParam().  Moved the
  logic in quote_pathname to HTQuoteParameter, extending that function to quote
  the parameter only if it contains characters which are problems with various
  shells (e.g., wildcards), and to escape backslashes.  In particular, use
  these functions to ensure that the user and port strings in HTTelnet.c are
  quoted (fixes a hole reported by Art Mulder <art@openbsd.org> - TD
* modify print-to-file logic to permit writing to pipe, provided that the
  user does not have no-shell restriction - TD
* split-out logic for LYValidateFilename() from printfile() and LYDownload - TD
* whitespace fixes - BJP
* add configure option --with-nls-datadir, to allow installer to specify
  alternate locale data directory.  A separate option from --datadir is
  required because the GNU gettext code is usually installed under
  $(prefix)/share rather $(prefix)/lib - TD
* add configure check for gettimeofday, to implement 0.1 second interval
  for skipping HTCheckForInterrupt() - TD
* modify configure script to generate references to $CONFIG_SHELL rather than
  /bin/sh, to allow some testing with alternate shells.  Autoconf uses this
  variable for a similar purpose - TD
* correct missing case for 'o', octal in StrAllocVsprintf (reported by IC) - TD
* fix -restrictions=bookmark check in forms-based options menu (reported by KW
  & Rodiger Geys) - LP
* fix memory leaks in LYPrint.c and UCdomap.c - KW
* when printing HEAD to email use URL in the subject, was title.  (it was
  especially annoying when we have 8bit title being sent as 7bit:  no charset
  information is supplied for letters with 7bit message body) - LP
* remove "temp fix for HText_trimHightext side effect from partial mode by
  introducing a flag in HText_beginInput()" from 1998-09-12 since it is now not
  needed after KW's changes in HText_trimHightext.  - LP
1998-12-03 (2.8.2dev.8)
* use HTSprintf/HTSprintf0 in LYCookie.c, LYLocal.c - TD
* correct logic in OpenHiddenFile, which did not check if a failure to open a
  file for append was due to the file's not existing and hence causing
  IsOurFile to return failure.  This caused the -traversal option to fail
  (reported by Francis Irving <francis@ncgraphics.co.uk>, applies to
  2.8.1rel.2) - TD
* fixed line number removal code in HText_endAnchor in several places, it was
  modifying the wrong line which could lead to memory corruption - KW
* tweaks in HText_startAnchor and HText_endAnchor for handling link numbers:
  don't swallow space after number if line was split, find link number on
  previous line even it it is at the very end, adjust line split position after
  number removal.  Generate TRACE output in interesting cases - KW
* prevent havoc (access to already freed memory etc.) caused by multiple
  recursive invocations of HTAnchor_delete on the same HTParentAnchor.  This
  does not seem to actually happen normally during a session, but can occur
  when the HTAnchor structures are cleaned up while handling a terminating
  signal or outofmem condition - KW
* reset the HTAnchor "underway" flag during final cleanup, so structures are
  not prevented from being freed.  This also should only make a difference when
  handling a terminating signal or outofmem condition - KW
* show sticky-bit in directory listings - LW
* correct options-message on Print page - IC
* update installation note about freewais library (reported by Chris Maden
  <crism@oreilly.com>) - TD
* improvements to mouse code, ncurses-based, from IZ (Ilya Zakharevich)
  a) Mouse navigation inside text entry fields;
  b) Mouse navigation to a text entry field (including an empty one)
  c) Mouse navigation to a specific position of a text field (since I do not
     know which fields are text fields, I implemented "b" and "c" for
     F_TEXTAREA_TYPE and F_TEXT_TYPE only, search for these symbols in the
     patch);
  d) Mouse navigation in menus:  To scroll, one can click on top/bottom border
     (single=byline, double=bypage, triple=beg/end), or above/below menu
     (single=bypage, double=beg/end)) mouse-3 ==> quit;
  e) Double-click-1 on the first and last row are interpreted as goto-
     start/end/main-window (depending on the location of the click).
  Other Changes:
  a) Ask ncurses for all mouse events, but increase mouseinterval() to simulate
     current behavior (which is effectively an infinite mouseinterval() +
     masking of repeated clicks);
  b) Earlier clicking to the left of a link would activate the link.  I see no
     use for this, so consider this a bug.
* HText_trimHightext (GridText.c):  don't apply final adjustment repeatedly to
  an anchor that has already been handled by this function; the function may be
  called repeatedly if partial display is enabled.  Some other changes in this
  function, to interact better with the other GridText.c functions, especially
  for partial display mode.  We don't have to handle all anchors if the new
  parameter "final" is not set.
  Also empty anchors should now generally not any more move down over empty
  lines, if they happen at a line end.  Made some trace messages give more
  information - KW
* color styles:  reset screen style cache to avoid random coloring when a link
  is unhighlighted - KW
* tweak in HText_setLastOptionValue:  if an OPTION tag was directly followed by
  several newlines, characters could be dropped - KW
* tweak havevisible() function in LYBookmark.c to compare against Unicode
  value rather than ASCII when checking for blanks. - LP
* ifdef user/group function caching calls so that this builds with djgpp, which
  doesn't need/support this (patch by Gisle Vanem)
* documentation updates for NLS - HN
* separate some html from gettext in LYCgi.c, LYHistory.c, LYLocal.c - JS
* avoid setting recent_sizechange during the very first start_curses call for
  ncurses.  This would result in an unnecessary refresh after loading the first
  document - KW
* added logic to display_page to avoid repainting the full screen contents in a
  specific situation:  if it has been called before (for the same lines in the
  same document) during partial display, and is now being called normally (not
  during partial display).  If this applies, the normal line content is not
  redrawn, but the title line and form fields are still repainted, and updating
  of the links structures is always done.  There are additional checks for
  recent_sizechange and a text->stale flag (which was already implemented but
  unused) to do the full redraw if that may be needed.  This should avoid
  unnecessary screen 'blinking' with curses when partial display is used (which
  didn't seem to happen with slang) - KW
* modify SGML.c to check for SGML_ELEMENT tag contents, fixing a case where an
  entity that appears within a TABLE but outside of any table row TR will be
  displayed by Lynx _without_ its entities being interpreted (analysis by Alan
  J Flavell <flavell@a5.ph.gla.ac.uk>, applies to 2.8.1rel.2) - KW
* check that stdin is really a tty before trying to select from it in the
  NSL-FORK logic in HTParseInet(), file HTTCP.c (reported by Kim DeVaughn, for
  someone who was unable to run lynx -dump in a cron job, applies to
  2.8.1rel.2) - TD, BL
* updates for lynx_help_main.html (JS, IC).
* change fopen for write in LYCookie.c to LYNewTxtFile so that the resulting
  file will be readable by only the owner (Bill Nottingham <wen2@po.cwru.edu>
  suggested using umask, but that may not be portable enough) - TD
* use CONST in some places in UCdomap.c and makeuctb, to make more tables
  sharable (suggested by LP) - TD
* fixes for SunOS K&R compiler with/without unproto wrapper, i.e., definition
  of 'const' - TD
1998-11-23 (2.8.2dev.7)
* convert KEY_ENTER to newline in LYgetch() to make Lynx work with IRIX's
  iris-ansi terminfo description, which equates the kent capability with
  carriage return.  Doing this will allow lynx to use the keypad "enter" key as
  an alias for carriage return on most terminals - KW
* correct a few missing ifdef's for disabling the partial-display logic - TD
* add/use new functions HTAA_UidToName(), HTAA_NameToUid(), HTAA_GidToName()
  and HTAA_NameToGid() to hide details of code which uses pwd.h and grp.h,
  as well as to cache the returned user/group names, improving performance
  in the dired screen - TD
* modify HTCheckForInterrupt() to check for interrupt no more than one per
  second, since this check is comparatively slow - TD
* modify ANSI_VARARGS case for HTSprintf() and HTSprintf0() to always use
  ANSI prototypes, since __STDC__ may not necessarily be defined on some
  systems, resulting in an inconsistent definition - PG
* add install-full rule to makefile.in - LV
* modify PutDefs macro in LYShowInfo.c to check for nonnull table[N].value,
  which may be null due to limitations of cfg_defs.sh script on some
  platforms where an empty string was intended (reported by LV, PG, applies
  to 2.8.1rel.2) - TD
* correct typo in 'make distclean' rule; an extra '-' prevented removal of
  .orig and .rej files (patch by LV).
1998-11-21 (2.8.2dev.6)
* add call on dbug_init to LYMain.c, allowing use of the debugging code built
  into the WATTCP code which is included in the DJGPP port of lynx.  This is
  activated by placing lines in the WATTCP.CFG file for:
    DEBUG.MODE= (choices are HEADERS, DUMP, or ALL)
    DEBUG.PROTO= (choices are TCP, UDP, or  ALL)
    DEBUG.FILE= (name of log file.  Defaults to WATTCP.DBG)
  This adds about 2K to the size of the stripped, compressed executable.  You
  get a log of the headers and/or a binary dump of the packets sent and
  received.  Maybe this will help in determining where ftp is failing in this
  port - DK
* correct definitions for ANSI_VARARGS, HAVE_STDARG_H in HTUtils.h (reported
  by LP, for djgpp) - TD
* correct logic in StrAllocVsprintf(), remove spurious test on dst_len
  (analysis by LV) - TD
1998-11-21 (2.8.2dev.5)
* modify HTLoadFile() to make compressed files work with OS/2 EMX and
  LYSystem() to convert forward slashes in pathnames to backslashes, also for
  EMX (patches by Ilya Zakharevich).
* documentation nits (apostrophes) in lynx.cfg and userdefs.h - LV
* fix inconsistent newlines in po/it.po (report by Irving_Wolfe@Wolfe.net) - TD
* modify config.guess, added Intergraph 2430 CLIX machines (reported by Alex
  Matulich <matuli_a@marlin.navsea.navy.mil>) - TD
* minor fix in LYCharSets.c according to recent changes in UCDefs.h introduced
  by IBM OS/2 codepage number - LP
* modify configure script to work with --enable-nls built into a subdirectory
  of the source tree (reported by PG) - TD
* disable regeneration of intl/po2tbl.sed and po/POTFILES if --disable-nls
  configure option is specified - TD
* add configure test for stdarg.h vs varargs.h - TD
* fixes to work with SunOS K&R compiler - TD
* don't trim trailing and leading spaces from unformatted text lines in some
  cases (split_line in GridText.c).  Prevents corruption of some uuencoded
  files when they are displayed and then 'P'rinted (although 'D'ownload should
  be used instead) - KW
* some changes in HText_appendCharacter (GridText.c).  Splitting of long SOURCE
  lines now works with color styles - KW
* workaround for multiple anchors in the same (invalid) HTML document with the
  same NAME and different destinations (HTAnchor.c) - KW
* check for 'z'ap while constructing local directory listings (non-VMS only, in
  HTFile.c) - KW
* added a couple outofmem checks (HTAnchor.c).  Minor TRACE message change in
  GridText.c for -tlog / USE_TRACE_LOG disabled - KW
* when adding bookmark entries, don't accept a title string which appears to
  consist only of blank characters (LYBookmark.c).  When rendering a bookmark
  file, use hiddenlinks=merge counting, so that numbers after entries with
  empty titles don't get out of whack (GridText.c).  This should prevent 'R'
  from removing the wrong bookmark entry - KW
* prevent generation of some unnecessary temp files when constructing mailcap
  file test commands (HTInit.c) - KW
* include LYLeaks.h in UCdomap.c for memory leak detection - KW
* fixed various memory leaks (UCdomap.c, LYShowInfo.c, LYReadCFG.c, LYMain.c,
  LYDownload.c, LYBookmark.c, HTML.c, DefaultStyle.c) - KW
* escape '&' and '<' in HTML generated to display current lynx.cfg option
  values (LYReadCFG.c) - KW
* revert logic in split_line.  Emphasis highlighting that should extend over
  several lines was being lost at line breaks (GridText.c).  (IsSpecialAttrChar
  probably shouldn't return true for LY_SOFT_NEWLINE since in most places it
  tests whether to skip a character position, but as long as this special char
  is only used in SOURCE mode it cannot mess up any anchor positions so it
  should be ok.  - KW
* correct character counting in SOURCE display continuation lines.  A
  highlighted search target would be shown shifted left by one character
  position because the LY_SOFT_NEWLINE special was displayed as '+' but not
  counted (GridText.c) - KW
* prevent generation of invalid/unparseable comments if
  UCSaveBookmarksInUnicode is in effect, other minor changes in
  LYBookmark.c - KW
* correction for color styles in HText_appendCharacter (GridText.c).  At some
  point a memmove was replaced by a for loop, but source and destination were
  reversed and the counter was wrong - KW
* modify HTSprintf/HTSprintf0 to use a more generic approach to varargs by
  using only va_alist in the parameter list - TD
* correct html expression in LYShowInfo.c of dev.3 which did not allow the temp
  file with the lynx.cfg settings to be accessed from the Configuration
  Definitions page (patch by IC - Ismael Cordeiro).
* correct "Exiting" message format in cleanup_sig(), which had unexpanded %d
  (reported by BJP) - TD
* add to config.hin the definitions set by AM_GNU_GETTEXT macro (PG pointed
  out that this also sets 'inline', needed for GNU gettext) - TD
* modify MakeNewTitle() to check for null pointer, fixing core dump with
  verbose images when value[src_type] is null (reported by John Bley
  <jbb6@acpub.duke.edu> for 2.8.1rel.2) - TD
1998-11-18 (2.8.2dev.4)
* change default for configure option of NLS (gettext) to disabled until we
  finish porting it to implementations other than GNU gettext.  Also,
  change default for include-gettext configure option to "with" - TD
* suppress cookie-storing if the value is null - BJP
* ifdef'd alternative set of line-edit bindings with EXP_ALT_BINDINGS, add
  configure option --enable-alt-bindings, rename DELEOL to DELEL, remove
  binding of DELEL to '\'. - TD
* add alternative set of line-edit bindings to change the behavior of the ^B
  and ^F line editor bindings to provide emacs/tcsh like behavior (cursor
  left/right), instead of "word" deletes.  Corrected a bug in the ^R (LYE_DELN)
  function, which is described as "delete next character", but was in fact
  performing identically to ^D (LYE_DELC) "delete current character".  Added a
  function called LYE_DELEL, which does the expected thing, and deletes
  from the current cursor position, to the EOL.
  New bindings:
    ^B = LYE_BACK   cursor backwards
    ^F = LYE_FORW   cursor forwards
    ^K = LYE_DELEOL delete to end-of-line
    ^T = LYE_DELNW  delete next word
    ^X = LYE_DELPW  delete previous word
    ^^ = LYE_UPPER  upper case line (not active when kbd-layout binding is)
    ^_ = LYE_LOWER  lower case line
  KED ((Kim DeVaughn <kimdv@best.com>)).
* modify to show address to submit to on the statusline when in advanced user
  mode.  Also fixes one small typo in LYMainLoop.c.  (suggested by
  <erisson@sw-tech.com>) - BJP
* modify HTParseInet() so that it works if stdin has been redirected to
  /dev/null, e.g., when running a cron job (reported by John H.  DuBois III
  <spcecdt@armory.com>) - BL
* minor documentation updates to lynx.cfg (Larry Virden).
* change some character constants from '\hex' and '\octal' form to decimal,
  to persuade compilers that upper-128 compares are legal - TD
* ifdef'd KEYBOARD_LAYOUT with EXP_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT, add configure option
  --enable-kbd-layout - TD
* implement EXP_CHARTRANS_AUTOSWITCH for OS/2 EMX (Sergey Svishchev).
* add 'a' response when printing a file to allow append rather than overwrite
  (Sergey Svishchev).
* add KEYBOARD_LAYOUT to lynx.cfg, to support character-translation on input,
  add missing line editing style selection to Options form.  This is enabled
  and disabled by the line edit control/uparrow (Sergey Svishchev
  <svs@ropnet.ru>).
* use exit_immediately() to reduce some signal-function clutter - LP
* correct dependency in src/makefile.in for cfg_defs.h (Masashi Fujita
  <objectx@bandit.co.jp>)
* change quoted includes in intl directory to bracketed includes - TD
1998-11-16 (2.8.2dev.3)
* misc documentation updates for the gettext/internationalization - LP
* rename po/makefile.in.in to po/makefile.inn, and modify distclean rule to
  remove the remaining generated files - TD
* add preliminary changes from PG (pg@sweng.stortek.com) to support port to
  OS/390, some ifdef'd with __MVS__, some with EBCDIC and NOT_ASCII.
* modify LYCookie.c to accept cookies with no value, in case the site resets a
  cookie by nulling out the value (reported by Larry Virden) - BJP
* modify cookie parsing to ignore comment lines beginning with a '#' (reported
  by Jonathan Bobin indicates that Netscape adds comments back, confusing Lynx)
  - BJP
* highlight option letters in old options screen (adapted from patch by Ismael
  Cordeiro) - TD
* use HTSprintf functions in HText_SubmitForm(), user_message(),
  LYLoadIMGmap(), HTTelnet.c.  (The HTTelnet.c modifications fix a security
  hole reported by Martin Mokrejs) - TD
* add HTSprintf, HTSprintf0 functions, to use in resolving potential buffer
  overflows - TD
* modify HTVMS_purge() to rename the remaining file to version 1 unless a
  permissions problem was encountered - TD
1998-11-10 (2.8.2dev.2)
* some testing against Solaris gettext implementation, enough to see that it is
  not really compatible either source or binary with GNU gettext.  For the time
  being, I recommend building NLS support only with GNU gettext (and
  --with-included-gettext to avoid conflict with Solaris' gettext in the
  standard library).  Otherwise use the --disable-nls configure option - TD
* various changes to configure script and makefiles to make this build with and
  without NLS - TD
* undo spurious substitutions such as gettext("") - TD
* modify some gettext() expressions to avoid embedding HTML in them - TD
* restore definitions in LYMessages_en.h - TD
* first cut of integrating Jim Spath's changes to incorporate message library
  support.

1998-09-07 (2.8.1dev.21-intl)
* About half through language hooks in WWW/Lib... - JES
  Integrated part of Chebucto's French translations. - JES
* Included latest ABOUT-NLS from GNU project,
1998-08-27 (2.8.1dev.21-intl)
* Tested language hooks using src/LYNews.c and Italian messages file
  provided by Sabato De Rosa <sabato.derosa@usa.net>.  Made changes to
  LYMain.c, LYMainLoop.c, LYNews.c and HTNews.c. - JES
1998-08-27 (2.8.1dev.21-intl)
* add hooks to GNU gettext for international language support - JES
  (This is an experimental modification that will be patched into
  the main Lynx release after other platform testing.  I've only done
  NetBSD.)

1998-11-05 (2.8.2dev.1)
* relax the cookie sanity checking for version 0 (old) cookies _only when_ the
  user has accept_all_cookies set (patch by Risto Widenius
  <widenius@ling.helsinki.fi>)
* modify get_listen_socket() to check if master_socket is set before attempting
  to use it in FD_CLR (patch by Karl-Andre Skevik <karls@kosmo.inet.no>)
* minor documentation fixes - DK
* use $(LIBS) symbol in src/chrtrans/makefile.in (reported by Alois Maier
  <m9235159@grz08u.unileoben.ac.at>)
* Fix core dump which may happen after printing-to-email. - LP
* Move read_rc() before parsing any command-line arguments (except -help)
  so the latter will override any .lynxrc settings.  In particular, the problem
  was detected with -cookie_file= which was ignored after saving values
  from Options menu. - LP
* Chartrans bug: LYNXIMGMAP now shows the text in right charset.
  (The page was converted twice, fixed by adding META charset to this internal
  page.  The bug was in all versions of Lynx starting from 2.7.1ac) - LP
* Oops, my typo from pre3 back to 27-09-98: windows-1252 appears twice
  in the list of character sets in options menu, was also typo in docs. - LP
* modify HTDOS.c to permit compile with K&R compiler - TD
1998-10-27 (2.8.1rel.2)
* tidy up version numbers - TD
* modify HTDOS.h to permit compile with K&R compiler - TD

1998-10-24 (2.8.1rel.1)
-----------------------
* reorganize lynx_help_main.html - PW
* minor change to WWW/.../tcp.h to eliminate redefinition warning by DEC C - TD
* move checking for command-line "-head" and related options before curses
  initialization so that program exits with correct terminal settings
  (report by LV, fix by BL).
* correct uninitialized index into id_append in makeuctb, which causes problems
  with def7_uni.tbl (analysis by LP)
* add TAGSOUP flag to lynx.cfg to set initial state of Tag Soup vs SortaSGML
  (request by LP) - TD
* add PERSISTENT_COOKIES flag to lynx.cfg to allow disabling the persistent
  cookies feature in a Lynx executable (request by BJP) - TD

  De Muyter <phdm@macqel.be>)
* modify cfg_defs.sh to work when the 'set' command emits double-quotes
  (pg@sweng.stortek.com)
* update obsolete copy of HTFWriter.c to add content-encoding for HTFileSuffix
  (reported by David Helder <dhelder@umich.edu) - TD
1998-10-17 (2.8.1pre.11)
* add dependency on cfg_defs.h to src/makefile.in for LYShowInfo.o
  (pg@sweng.stortek.com)
* modify add_item_to_list() so that if the restriction flag is omitted from
  a download/upload/extern line in lynx.cfg, it is assumed true.  Also check
  for null command string in LYExtern.c (bug report by HN) - TD
* modify logic in forms-options menu so that assume_char_set now works
  correctly for any LYRawMode value by synchronizing gen_options() and
  postoptions() via rawmode memory - LP
* correct ifdef'ing in LYShowInfo.c for non-Unix platforms - LP
* modify nsl_fork logic to handle a case where child exits successfully
  right after parent's select timed out (reported by Serge Munhoven) - BL
* small updates to lynx_help files and other documentation (BJP, PW, LV).
* add #define's for later work to simplify configuring the maximum number
  of cookies (suggested by BJP) - TD
* flush output in makeuctb, as possible fix for build problems on systems that
  do not implement POSIX 'exit()' call (reported by Serge Munhoven
  <munhoven@mema.ucl.ac.be> and Jan Hlavacek <lahvak@math.ohio-state.edu>) - TD
* put GOTOBUFFER, JUMPBUFFER and QUIT_DEFAULT_YES back the way they used to be
  (majority decision) - TD
1998-10-14 (2.8.1pre.10)
* add/use HTSYS_purge and HTSYS_remove functions (based on report by Tony
  Bolton and patch by BJP dealing with removing older versions of cookie files)
  - TD
* add --disable-config-info option - TD
* change configure script --enable-forms-options to --disable-forms-options,
  add --disable-menu-options - TD
* comment-out FM's code to fold cookie headers and force cookies to be
  presented in the same order that they were received - BJP
* use full "Implementation" directory name in include path in WWW djgpp
  makefile - DK
* use HTDOS_name() to force DOS temporary-directory into consistent form - DK
* include HTVMSUtils.h and HTDOS.h from LYUtils.h, consolidate some ifdef's
  using macro HTSYS_name - TD
* another fix for HTTCP.c, for lookups with Lynx/32 - WB
* add fallback to $TMPDIR for Lynx temporary directory on Unix - TD
* remove verbose_links variable due to popular demand - TD
1998-10-10 (2.8.1pre.9)
* add verbose_links variable to lynx.cfg and userdefs.h to control whether Lynx
  should show "(LINK)" before links (request/patch by Moshe Zadka
  <moshez@math.huji.ac.il>) - TD
* change defaults in lynx.cfg and userdefs.h, add comments - PW
  (a) defaults are stated for `verbose' & `KB';
  (b) GOTOBUFFER & JUMPBUFFER defaults to TRUE;
  (c) QUIT_DEFAULT_YES defaults to FALSE
* restore suggested file name in download menu:  it is really useful for other
  download methods which should be available in menu when `save to disk' is
  disabled.  Remove local_path/ prefix (LYNX_SAVE_SPACE if any) from visible
  suggested file name string near the top instead - LP
* restore newline position when toggling comments parsing (at least we could
  return to previous screen to try comments toggling twice) - LP
* add a link from keystrokes help for edit_help.html (input line keys) - LP
* corrected to make -nostatus command-line option override HTReadProgress - TD
* updates to lynx-dev.html (Al Gilman).
* modify NSL-fork support in HTTCP.c to use waitpid call to reap child
  processes which may otherwise become orphaned.  The new variable
  "dns_patience" represents how many seconds we're willing to wait for DNS to
  respond (should later make it configurable) - BL
* modify PutTextInput and PutDefs macros in LYOptions.c and LYShowInfo.c to
  avoid pre-ANSI compilers attempting to substitute macro parameters in
  coincidental matches within quoted strings - BL
  gcc -Wtraditional reports the first, but not the second, which is "n"
  substituted into "\n" - TD
* add an error-check for fg/bg values to lynx_chg_color function in case
  lynx.cfg specifies color names not in Lynx's table - BL
* modify IsOurFile function to accommodate links-to-links, so that users whose
  home directory is reached by that type of path can save .lynxrc file
  (reported by PW) - TD
1998-10-04 (2.8.1pre.8)
* modify HTTCP.c to copy soc_in from phost in HTParseInet, making Lynx/32 do
  lookups again - WB
* modify LYCurses.c to compile mouse-code with Borland C and PDCURSES 2.3 - WB
* correct backward logic in CF_TERMIOS_AND_CURSES (reported by LE) - TD
1998-10-04 (2.8.1pre.7)
* add special-case CF_TERMIOS_AND_CURSES configure macro (fixes problem
  reported by Philippe De Muyter) - TD
* update/reorganize option_help.html - PW
* restore newline position when return from the Print menu or follow a link
  from History page (was broken for partial display mode only):  LYPop() and
  LYPop_num now reinitialize Newline_partial if it happens on getfile stage.
  Also remove changes from 1998-06-11 (case LYK_DOWNLOAD) since this is now
  protected by HText_new() which never starts.  - LP
* tweak suggested filename for download menu: now it we have URL
  terminated with "/" (e.g., a directory or possibly root) do one more try -
  remove terminating "/" - LP
* download menu: do not show "Suggested file name" when "save to disk disabled"
  (requested by HN) - LP
* more tweaks on LYshow_kb_rate - LP
* move fallback definitions for POSIX S_ISLNK, etc., to allow build with
  VAX C (reported by Tony Bolton) - TD
* add parentheses to eval-expression in CF_MAKE_INCLUDE configure test to
  accommodate bash2 (Tadayoshi Okuma <tad@pht.co.jp>)
1998-10-01 (2.8.1pre.6)
* add EMX to special cases for SetOutputMode, to force stdout to O_BINARY mode
  so that downloading binary files will not corrupt them (reported by Ilya
  Zakharevich <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>) - TD
* correct missing "\n\" in change to LYrcFile.c for pre.4 (reported by David
  Eaton) - TD
* reorder HTCheckForInterrupt() so that partial display mode will work for
  VMS (reported by LP) - TD
* fix LYK_DOWNLOAD to restrict downloading remote links for local_host_only,
  like it was done for mailto: links recently, see comments where in. - LP
* replace few statusline messages with ones from LYMessages.en.h
1998-09-30 (2.8.1pre.5)
* force compile on VMS to use stdarg.h; it was ifdef'd for __STDC__ which
  VAX C does not define, though it does support stdarg.h (reported by Tony
  Bolton).  Test-compile HTVMS_WaisUI.c on Linux to check... - TD
* update url for tcplib in INSTALLATION - DK
* fix HTDOS_name trace massage - LP
* expand "~" in include-statements in lynx.cfg (reported by LP) - TD
* remove some obsolete stuff from INSTALLATION - HN
* DOSPATH fix: user input URL like c:/path/file.ext (begins with drive letter)
  now resolved as local path and will not be passed to DNS search in any case
  (was running URL guessing process for host "c:" if file.ext not found...)
  fix LYFillLocalFileURL() - LP
* fix HTUserMsg2 trace massage - LP
* add user's guide documentation for COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and
  COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAINS - BJP
* change default Unix cookie-file name to "~/.lynx_cookies" - BJP
* customize incremental rendering:
  - add -partial_thres[=NUMBER] option to set the number of lines
  - add PARTIAL_THRES config variable in lynx.cfg to set the number of lines
  - add partial_thres variable in .lynxrc to set the number of lines.
    Selecting save to disk and hitting Accept Changes in options menu will save
    this variable to the current value.  Haven't looked into making a form
    entry for this yet.  With -partial_thres command line option, probably not
    necessary (patch by Eric <erbrun@bellatlantic.net>).
* fix some text in lynx.man and Lynx_user_guide.html.  The man change includes
  changes to "h" and "k" so they work whether or not vi keys are on - DK
* workaround for inconsistency between slang ports to DOS and other platforms
  by suppressing test of SLtt_Use_Ansi_Colors.  This fixes a problem where
  colors change in the slang DOS port when the forms_based option menu is
  accepted - DK
1998-09-28 (2.8.1pre.4)
* tentative fix for HPUX sed problems (reported by jones.peter@uqam.ca) - TD
* update lynx.man and lynx.hlp to reflect new command-line options - TD
* minor documentation fix - LP
* miscellaneous fixes for build on VMS (reported by Tony Bolton) - TD
* tweak 'const' assignment for VMS (in LYReadCFG.c and LYPrint.c) - LP
* clarify discussion of download in Lynx user's guide (Al Gilman).
* trim trailing newline from lines read from cookie file so that Lynx does
  not send embedded newlines in the cookie list - BJP
1998-09-27 (2.8.1pre.3)
* fix a place in cookie_add{accept,reject}list() where cookies would be deleted
  from memory if a persistent cookie had the same domain as an entry in
  COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS - BJP
* move Lynx's writing of persistent cookies to COOKIE_FILE from happening when
  you enter the Cookie Jar page to quit time, before cleaning up temporary
  files - BJP
* Lynx_user_guide.html: add text about lynx.cfg - LP
* forms-options: options names moved 2 columns to the right (is it good?) - LP
* fix reading .lynxrc "character_set" (trim trailing spaces in fullname) - LP
* fix ReadProgress message for LYshow_kb_rate (while <1024 bytes received
  we showed byte-transfer rate even in KB mode), extra dot removed - LP
* DOS text files: opening text mode switch now incorporated in LYNewTxtFile/
  LYAppendToTxtFile and hope for the best - LP
1998-09-25 (2.8.1pre.2)
* fixed forms submission charset: was broken by me in dev26 (HText_SubmitForm()
  in GridText.c) - LP
* documentation updates for verbose images - LP
* minor fix for trace message in TrimHightext() -LP
* add compatibility with 2.8/2.7.2 lynx.cfg and (especially) .lynxrc - old
  "character_set" parameter now acceptable - LP
* add OUTGOING_MAIL_CHARSET symbol to lynx.cfg to make mail more recognizable
  by remote recipient, it may be "US-ASCII" for 7 bit approximation as the
  safest case or any other value.  If blank, use display character set
  (default, compatibility).  Currently implemented only for "subject" in
  "print-to-email" - LP
* fix SGML.c so invalid characters are not dispalayed in hex UHHHH but just
  omitted as already done for plain/text mode - LP
* fix download' suggested file name (8bit) - LP
* correct logic error in "Change Location" command, and allow "~" there in
  addition to the existing "~/" prefix (reported by Ismael Cordeiro) - TD
* ifdef'd out "don't replace '\n' with ' ' if Chinese or Japanese" from dev.23,
  with symbol EXP_JAPANESE_SPACES, FIX_JAPANESE_SPACES based on discussion with
  HN, LP - TD
* correct missing '\' in generated sed-script for "make install-help" rule,
  which changed a couple of "/html" substrings to ".html" (reported by BL) - TD
* modify cfg_defs.sh script to handle empty token in config.cache, e.g., a line
  such as "foo=${foo=}" (reported by Philip Chong <pchong@boopsie.ml.org>) - TD
* modify so that lynx_cfg_infopage() and lynx_compile_opts() pages are not
  invoked when Lynx is running -anonymous - TD
1998-09-22 (2.8.1pre.1)
* correct logic error in parse_restrictions() which caused infinite loop,
  probably from changes in dev.8 (reported by HN) - TD
* add SHOW_KB_RATE symbol to lynx.cfg to allow user to control whether
  HTReadProgress should show KB/sec or bytes/sec - TD
* modify HTReadProgress to allow user to display KB/sec or bytes/sec - BL
* add/use new function LYstyles(), to force initialization of styles[] array
  when it is used outside HTML.c; fixes a problem with Lynx not using styles
  for files listed on the command line - TD
* correct keymap strings for F1 and DO_KEY - TD
* add keymap table entries for F1, to accommodate slang which appears to ignore
  terminal description when keymaps are defined - TD
1998-09-20 (2.8.1dev.29)
* add checks/warnings for user agent string in forms-options menu - TD
* change render_item to force a '/' before substituted path or directory
  strings if (as in OS/2 EMX) absolute filenames do not normally begin with a
  '/' -TD
* modify HTnameOfFile_WWW() to interpret an empty acc_method as a local file,
  allowing its use in permit_location(), making OS/2 EMX dired-mode change
  permissions work - TD
* make download and print menus a little more compact in intermediate/advanced
  user modes - TD
* correct filename shown in download menu - LP
* change behavior of configure --enable-forms-options switch.  By default, both
  old and new options menu are available via a command-line toggle
  "-forms_options" or lynx.cfg statement "FORMS_OPTIONS:TRUE/FALSE".  Configure
  --enable-forms-options now _disables_ old-style code, which is
  ifdef'ed with "#ifndef EXP_FORMS_OPTIONS" - LP
* add more pointer-checks in GridText.c so that "lynx LYNXDOWNLOAD://" does
  not crash (reported by Wilson Cheung) - TD
* add special case to handle NNTPSERVER environment variable, which had been
  lowercased as part of LYReadCFG.c cleanup (reported by Wilson Cheung
  <wcheung@netcom.com>) - TD
* modify info-page to add link to new internal page showing the noncomment
  lines from lynx.cfg - LP, TD
* use function wwwName to reduce clutter - LP
* create "lynx.cfg Information" page, comments skipped, "include" OK.
  The link is available from '='InfoPage and 'O'ptions menu.
  Since DJGPP/Win32 binary have no built-in absolute path for distributions
  lynx.cfg those ports will look for a copy of lynx.cfg in lynx_help/
  for most advanced info/comments (if you made http:// depository for lynx help
  please care of it) - LP
* tweak helpfilepath URL (for DOSPATH only) - LP
* some cleanup of cp852, cp850, cp775 - LP
1998-09-17 (2.8.1dev.28)
* minor fix to make PRCS ProjectDate print in "dd mmm yyyy" form - TD
1998-09-17 (2.8.1dev.27)
* minor fixes for recent (dev24 and dev25) chartrans changes - LP
* add LYNX_DATE definitions in userdefs.h; Info Page now shows the date of your
  lynx along with version number and a link to the latest sources.  - LP
* use ECHO_CC symbol in install-help rule to control whether the sed commands
  are echoed - TD
* corrected install-help rule to avoid getting compress-suffix repeated in
  the generated/updated files - TD
* documentation nit for COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS (Michael Warner)
* use getsockname_s rather than getsockname for djgpp (from patch by Gisle
  Vanem) - DK
* add .bz2 suffix to lynx.cfg and HTInit.c, for bzip2 utility - DK
* modify store_cookie to suppress warning message for invalid domain if Lynx is
  setup to accept all cookies - LV
* modify/expand LYLocalFileToURL() function, getting rid of most places where
  inline concatenation is used for "file://localhost/<filename>", as well
  as eliminating a number of static buffers - TD
* move fallback definitions for POSIX S_ISLNK, etc., out of NeXT ifdef's, to
  make this compile on Apollo (reported by David Eaton) - TD
* restructured pathname-tests in LYLocal.c, using common utility functions
  ok_stat, ok_lstat, ok_file_or_dir to simplify freeing pointer allocated
  by HTfullURL_toFile - TD
* modify HTLocalName, making it a macro around a more flexible function
  HTnameOfFile_WWW, to reuse logic for stripping off "file://localhost" and
  "file:" prefixes, fixing some places where a spurious '/' would be left in
  EMX local filenames (other macros: HTfullURL_toFile, HTpartURL_toFile) - TD
* modify configure script macro CF_PATH_PROGS for OS/2 EMX, so that compiled-in
  utility pathnames work - TD
* use HTDOS.c module for OS/2 EMX, since it has similar device syntax - TD
* correct logic for wrapping long lines, to not use the rightmost column of the
  screen, fixes a problem with duplicated character (reported by LP) - TD
* correct logic for dumping screen to file, so that blank lines are retained,
  not counted in the logic for pruning soft-newlines which supports wrapped
  lines - TD
* add info and user messages to traces - TD
1998-09-12 (2.8.1dev.26)
* change behavior of NSL_FORK and related I/O (patch by BL)
  - Make URL guessing (www.huh.com?  www.huh.org?  www.huh.net?) interruptible.
  - Make URL guessing from the command line interruptible.
  - Use select() instead of FIONREAD.  This makes it work on OSes where
    previously it only *looked* like it was working.
  - select() on stdin as well as the child pipe, when using [n]curses (not
    SLANG).  This allows interrupt to be processed instantly, without
    up-to-1-second delay.
  - While looping, 1 second at a time, bail out after "too many" (currently 50)
    loops:  just in case something weird happens, like select() returning some
    unexpected error that we ignore.
  - Make sure child processes are always killed and reaped.
  - Close pipe ends as soon as possible.
  - Now write the length down the pipe (using a known-to-the-program length of
    sizeof(int)) first -- this both helps workaround old CMU TCP bugs and the
    fact that select() doesn't let us get number of bytes ready, like FIONREAD
    does.
* change default for NO_ANONYMOUS_EMAIL to TRUE (patch by HN)
* use url for "W3C HTML Validation Service" rather than "A Kinder, Gentler HTML
  Validator"
* update url for HTML Quick Reference Guide (report by LE) - TE
* modify verbose images to show ISMAPs and USEMAPs (patch by LE).
* fix typos in AttrList.h, LYStrings.h (reported by LV & HN) - TD
* Chartrans recovery and cleanup:  by introducing an invariant
  "current_char_set and UCLYhndl_for_unspec always valid charsets" we solve
  possible problems with invalid/undeclared charsets.  Use
  'safeUCGetLYhndl_byMIME()' for reading charset information from
  lynx.cfg/userdefs.h/command line switches to recover possible typos by
  fallback to ISO-8859-1; If UCLYhndl_for_unrec or UCLYhndl_HTFile_for_unspec
  not set explicitely - now fallback to UCLYhndl_for_unspec (was before, but
  not clear in certain places).  Add comments to UCMap.h, add comments on
  chartrans initialization in LYMain.c.  UCAssume_localMIMEcharset and
  UCAssume_unrecMIMEcharset now removed (UCLYhandl_* do all the stuff).  - LP
* LYCharSets.c:  LYRawMode code simplified and comments added.  It was realized
  that UCAssume_MIMEcharset may differ from its handler as LYRawMode history.
  Also:  HTMLSetRawModeDefault() moved into HTMLUseCharacterSet() to reduce
  clutter, declare HTMLSetCJKCharacterSet() as PRIVATE.  - LP
* more "big5" bugs fixed (in HTMIME.c and HTFile.c); function Set_HTCJK() added
  to LYCharSets.c - LP
* LYCharUtils.c:  META charset code corrected against 2.7.2, obsolete code
  removed - LP
* partial mode now repaint the screen in one stage with a complete display
  ('display_lines' received, fix in HTPartialDisplay()).  Incremental rendering
  of the first page may be annoying on slow connection (reported by Nelson
  Henry Eric <nelsonhe@nara.kindai.ac.jp>) - LP
* temp fix for HText_trimHightext side effect from partial mode by introducing
  a flag in HText_beginInput(), so this side effect still only happens for long
  documents with forms input mixed with normal href= link.  - LP
* print menu: fixed document URL near the top (was temp file name) - LP
* forms-options menu: fixed screen size in Novice mode - LP
* limit length of strings copied via tok_values[] in LYCookie.c - TD
* clean up a few memory leaks in cookie_add_acceptlist() and
  cookie_add_rejectlist() in LYCookie.c.  These were leaking 4 bytes for each
  entry in COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS - BJP
* fix to LYLoadCookies() which was causing duplicate invalid cookies to be
  loaded - BJP
* split out install-doc rule in top-level makefile to install extra
  documentation files in $(libdir)/lynx_doc (request by HN) - TD
* improved algorithm to set 'secure_value', used in forms-options to circumvent
  spoofing (based on comments from Mike Castle) - TD
* integrate WB's mouse changes (see 1997-04-24) for page-up/down into the Unix
  flavors of mouse support (e.g., ncurses and slang) - TD
* use ncurses define_key to implement lynx-keymaps (see dev.10) - TD
* modify slang keymap code to work with slang 0.99-38 - TD
* replace several ifdef'd pathname constructions to use LYAddPathToHome() - TD
* make keymaps file consistently named on Unix and VMS - TD
* remove redundant "Lynx" from internal-page titles (suggested by LP) - TD
* remove install-log makefile target, generate cfg_defs.h file directly from
  lynx_cfg.h and config.cache, to compile-in the configuration-definitions
  rather than rely on external file lynx_site.txt - TD
1998-09-06 (2.8.1dev.25)
* corrected compiled-in path for lynx_site.txt - TD
* implement logic for exec-links in forms-options page - TD
* add configure options --enable-exec-links and --enable-exec-scripts - TD
* correct logic for show-color in forms-options page (reported by DK) - TD.
* implement logic to set $DISPLAY in forms-options page - TD
* add/use functions LYsetXDisplay() and LYgetXDisplay() to reduce clutter - TD
* retain help-link on internal pages only for those where the pages would be
  pushed onto the history stack, and only in novice mode - TD
* absorb LYSystem.h into LYUtils.h, adding LYSystem() and LYSysShell functions
  to LYUtils.c to hide djgpp clutter - TD
* limit strings passed to mailer in LYMail.c to 7-bit ASCII, converting other
  characters to '?'.  This guards against trash on the end of the mailing
  address in a mailto link (from Duncan Simpson <dps@io.stargate.co.uk>).
* add fallback definitions for <sys/stat.h> S_xxx macros to tcp.h (from report
  by Francisco A Tomei Torres <fatomei@sandburg.unm.edu> that OpenStep 4.0
  lacks definition for S_IWOTH) - TD
* modify quote_pathname() so that for DJGPP it does not put single-quotes
  around the result - DK
* correct a missing assignment to turn bold off in split_line (GridText.c) - LE
* Fixed: forms input in display_partial mode!  Previously hightext was printed
  at wrong positions while loading was in process (try -debug_partial to see
  the bug).  Fix made in HText_pageDisplay:  we call HText_trimHightext() which
  was the main part of HText_endAppend() before.  Seems no more problems
  reported from incremental rendering mode!  - LP
* set PARTIAL mode ON by default, unless it disabled in lynx.cfg or by
  configure --disable-partial option - LP
* restore temporary -debug_partial switch, broken in dev.23. - LP
* made trace in HText_appendCharacter() a little more readable
  for lynx special characters - LP
* chartrans:  human-readable character set names in Options Menu now changed
  according to Netscape 4.x style - "language (MIMEname)", it looks more useful
  and reduce chaos in people's heads.  Documentation corrected
  (option_help.html/Lynx_User_guide.html).  Minor tip:  "Central and Eastern
  European" was truncated to "Eastern European" because of space limitation in
  popup menu.  (Changes in chrtrans/*.tbl, LYCharSets.c, also docs including
  userdefs.h/lynx.cfg).  Since names were changed, users on display other than
  iso-8859-1 should go to options menu and resave .lynxrc (and probably correct
  lynx.cfg - character_set now uses MIME notation in sync with other charset
  settings, although complete name string is still acceptable for this field).
  - LP
* an attempt made to tweak the code replacing lynx internal 'main' charset '0'
  (iso-8859-1 in fact) with its MIME name. - LP
* rename ifdef EXP_8BIT_TOUPPER in favor of lynx.cfg switch FORCE_8BIT_TOUPPER
  - LP
* remove a lot of "(char **)" casts from HTML.c which obscured some type
  mismatches - TD
* add/use functions LYIsHtmlSep, LYAddHtmlSep, LYTrimHtmlSep, LYIsPathSep,
  LYAddPathSep, LYTrimPathSep to reduce clutter - TD
* fix a bug, present at least since dev.17, where lynx can't download files if
  it is started from one of the root directories of a disk drive, since it is
  trying to write to "c:\\file.ext", rather than "c:\file.ext" - DK
* correct a comment in userdefs.h; commercial Japanese sites are named with
  co.jp, not com.jp (LV).
* correct some debug messages in LYCookie.c - BJP
* fix a missing </h1> in ShowInfo.c - SKY
* modified '+'->' ' conversion to allow Unix commands to have '+' beginning
  options - TD
* sorted all option items (i.e., static variables, postoptions(),
  gen_options()) according to the sections they are in - SKY
* added '+'->' ' conversion for forms-options values - SKY
* centered 'save to disk' and put a dash between 'accept' and 'reset' for
  clarity - SKY
* add "-cookie_file=" commandline option to specify cookie file - BJP
* add "cookie_file=" option to .lynxrc - BJP
* add "cookie_file:" option to lynx.cfg - BJP
* change default cookie file to "Home_Dir()/cookies" (or sys$login:cookies
  for VMS, which may or may not work, DOS also needs to be checked) - BJP
* add cookies switch to options menu - LP
* Security considerations and form-based options:  items restricted in
  gen_options() should be ALSO restricted under the same conditions in
  postoptions() to prevent a limited access user to edit option's HTML code
  manually and submit a restricted items.  This may be not a good idea to have
  two functions in sync but those functions are synchronized anyway.  Please
  read comments inside the functions if change something!  - LP
* add new functions BeginInternalPage and EndInternalPage to reduce clutter in
  code that sets up internal pages (email from LP).
* change version in makefile.in to 2-8-1 (reported by DK).
* the code in GridText that adds control characters to the current line
  does not test for buffer overflow.  Normally Lynx gets away with this because
  it will wrap the current line as soon as the line exceeds the display width,
  but if you have a file with nothing but control characters with no
  displayable text in-between (a few thousand hidden links will do), then Lynx
  bombs.  Modified to silently ignore excess control characters as well as add
  a few extra bytes when allocating the line buffer to allow for a bunch of
  control characters followed by a kanji or utf-8 sequence.  (patch by Dick
  Wesseling <ftu@fi.uu.nl>)
* remove WWW/Library/Implementation/HTInit.c, which is not used, since
  src/HTInit.c has this functionality - TD
* change ID="<number>" in Lynx_users_guide.html to ID="<name>" to appease
  weblint; tested with IE&NS - TD.
* Al's convention of '#<number>' into '#<id name>' in Lynx_users_guide.html is
  included - SKY
1998-08-31 (2.8.1dev.24)
* re-correct DH's patch for COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS (reported by LV) - TD
1998-08-29 (2.8.1dev.23)
* make interim fix for gzip'd html files until we can resolve portability
  issues raised by SKY's renaming - TD
* implement LY_SOFT_NEWLINE, to mark places where wrapping is done in
  HText_appendCharacter, to allow printing to join lines back together
  (reported by LP) - TD
* correct missing assignment in change to HText_appendCharacter, fix a core
  dump - TD
* removed SKY's change that attempted to skip help-links, since it causes a
  core dump, e.g., when viewing source - TD
* use LYCloseTempFP in forms-options code and LYPrint.c where file was opened
  with LYOpenTemp, to fix a core dump - TD
* All XYZ_TITLE defines of UIPs (User Interface Page) are collected in
  LYMessages_en.h for multi language support - SKY
* Head and H1 of each UIP is standardized; reduced to 1 line.  In this line a
  context sensitive Help anchor introduced which is skipped by default; i.e.,
  'd' will directly goto 'Save to Disk' not to the help anchor - SKY
* Download and Print UIPs are divided into 'Standard' and 'Local additions'.
  Current and Suggested Filenames are printed on the page which was hidden on
  the status line or accessed only by '=' - SKY
* Information page now has links to either development or lynx home pages
  depending on LYNX_RELEASE define.  Besides compile options can also be
  accessed on this page:  $helpdir/lynx_site.txt.  A file derived from
  'config.cache'.  Its corresponding makefile macro is 'install-log' - SKY
* New Form-based options page is re-organized; logical sections are introduced
  and sorted alphabetically (except for 'User Mode' - SKY
* All links in the help files are marked, i.e., each
  'href="../_filename.html_#section"' is converted to
  'href="../@FILENAME@#section"'.  This is useful if a help filename or
  link has to be changed through out whole package.
* 'lynx_help/help_files.txt' is introduced which contains
  FILENAME=_filename.html_ definitions.  Format and details are given in the
  file - SKY
* All help files are renamed from '.html' -> '.html_' - SKY
* For context sensitive help links in UIPs 'src/LYHelp.h' is created with all
  the filenames marked like the help files.  It will be included from
  LYGlobal.h.  In 'src/makefile.in' necessary changes are done to load the
  filenames from 'lynx_help/help_files.txt' - SKY
* To be able to compress help files '--enable-gzip-help' option is added in
  configure script.  In 'makefile' 'install-help:' is updated.
  If COMPRESS_PROG and COMPRESS_EXT are *both* left empty (default) no
  compression will be carried.  For the moment compression is restricted only
  to 'gzip'.  Necessary updates are done in configure.in - SKY
* documentation fixes for nsl-fork, print screen - PW
* don't replace '\n' with ' ' if Chinese or Japanese - HN
* use title information rather than suggested filename as a subject line when
  printing a page to email - LP
* add verbose_images to old-style options menu, and the .lynxrc - LE
* add verbose_images and useragent to forms-based options menu - LP
* disable download of "mailto:" links (reported by SKY (Sinan Kaan Yerli)
  <sky@star.cpes.susx.ac.uk> ) - LP
* Change HTUserMsg to HTInfoMsg for "ALREADY_AT_BEGIN" and "ALREADY_AT_END"
  messages to make it less annoying - LP
* reduce clutter in mainloop by inserting LYpop() in postoptions() - LP
* makefile.dos: split long lines - LP
* Fix bug with TAIPEI big5 charset in src/LYCharUtils.c
  (this typo also found in lynx2.7.2: "big-5" instead of "big5"),
  patch by Shou-Chuan Lai <chuan@cs.nthu.edu.tw> - LP
* Add -debug_partial command line switch so we got MessageSecs dely
  between incremental rendering stages if partial display mode is ON.
  (MessageSecs available from lynx.cfg and set to 2 sec by default).
  The problem in incremental rendering of forms input was reported by SKY
  (Sinan Kaan Yerli) <sky@star.cpes.susx.ac.uk> ), still not fixed
  but now we may enter form-based options menu in -debug_partial mode
  and rerender the page with Cntrl-R to see what is happening in fact. - LP
* Serious bug fixed for DISP_PARTIAL: two asynchronous processes synchronized.
  HTDisplayPartial() synchronized by flag against HText_new() which create
  the new HTMainText object.  Otherwise HTDisplayPartial() sometimes was
  matching old HTMainText (with its own line counter) and repaint previous doc,
  not a new one.  TRACE log now got a message from HText_pageDisplay - LP
* fixed last chartrans changes, lines such as
      #0x99    #NOTDEFINED
  should not be commented with leading comment symbol because they are ignored
  by makeuctbl in fact - LP
* modify DH's patch for COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS to only modify the nonstandard case,
  thereby making that more restrictive, and restoring standard behavior
  (reported by HN) - TD
1998-08-21 (2.8.1dev.22)
* correct test for -std1 compiler option on Digital Unix (reported by Michael
  Warner) - TD
* modify treatment of COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS, so that if it is set TRUE, two or more
  concurrent BRs will be collapsed into a single blank line.  Note that the
  valid way to insert extra blank lines in HTML is via a PRE block with only
  newlines in the block (David Henderson <davidh@psiphi.org>)
* clarification in userdefs.h - HN
* MS Windows codepages updated for EURO SIGN (0x20AC), from ftp.unicode.org -LP
* minor fix for DISP_PARTIAL, disable scrolling when HTTP request already sent
  but the new document not displayed on the screen yet - LP
* ifdef DOS/WINDOWS to open lynx.trace in text mode - LP
* rearrange text in lynx.cfg concerning character_set - LP
* correct miscellaneous typos - LP
* Fixed:  Verbose images now work with [IMAGE]-Submit.  Also, fixed the core
  dump when clickable_images is on.  The problem was an oversight in
  MakeNewTitle() - LE
* reviewed the INSTALLATION file as it relates to DOS and updated it for the
  newly released version of PDCurses 2.3.  Added the HAVE_GETBKGD define to
  makefile.dos, fixes some of the unusual background color handling that was
  present in the PDCurses DOS port - DK
* correct ifdef:  LYOptions.c fails to build with -DEXP_FORMS_OPTIONS but
  _without_ -DDIRED_SUPPORT (e.g., djgpp) - LP
* redesigned cookie_add_{accept,reject}list in LYCookie.c -- they work now -BJP
* added COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS in .lynxrc handling to LYrcFile.c - BJP
* slight spacing fix in lynx.cfg - BJP
* added blurb in lynx.cfg about COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS - BJP
* -accept_all_cookies on the commandline works as a toggle now (against
  lynx.cfg value -- NOT against .lynxrc value) - BJP
* change HTAlert for bad partial reference to an HTUserMsg to make it less
  annoying (request by Philip Webb, Jason McBrayer)
1998-08-15 (2.8.1dev.21)
* correct pathname for help file in forms-options screen - TD
* reduce clutter in LYOptions.c with SELECTED, DISABLED, NOTEMPTY macros,
  PutOptValues, GetOptValues functions - TD
* modified LYOptions to include MBM support from form-based options,
  by making a link href="LYNXOPTIONS://MBM_MENU" like it was in LYPrint.c and
  calling edit_bookmarks() from postoptions() - LP
* add/use HTUserMsg to encapsulate most of the important messages - TD
* add/use HTInfoMsg to encapsulate most of the informational messages - TD
* make most of the alert messages use HTAlert, for consistency - TD
* exclude forms-options pages from Visited Links page - LP
* The current keymapping for the DOS Slang ports maps the keys directly to lynx
  actions via keymap.c.  There are several places in the code that test for
  arrow keys, page up or down, home and end for special handling that depend on
  the lynx definition of the keys.  Hence, the keys in the DOS Slang ports were
  failing the tests and not working as expected.  The following patch now maps
  these special keys.  They can no longer be mapped individually via the KEYMAP
  mechanism in lynx.cfg.  Arrows should now work in GOTO fields.  Tested the
  patch against the binaries maade by makefile.dos, makefile.dsl, and
  makefile.wsl - DK
* The wsl port seems to be working well with DISP_PARTIAL, make this the
  default - DK
* correct spelling in lynx.cfg - DK
* modify HText_appendCharacter to wrap long lines when displaying HTML document
  source - TD
* add configure option --enable-cgi-links - TD
* clarify discussion of no_proxy in lynx.cfg (Al Gilman).
* Multilingual bookmarks:  now we store characters >127 in bookmark titles with
  a more consistent and independent way, by keeping in unicode as &#UUUU
  (NCR=numeric character reference).  The idea belongs to Klaus Weide & Andrey
  Chernov (long ago).  It may be useful if we need switching display charset
  frequently.  This is the case when you use lynx on different platforms, e.g.
  on UNIX and from remote PC, but want to keep common bookmarks file valid.
  Compatibility:  NCR as part of I18N and HTML4.0 specifications supported
  starting with Lynx 2.7.2, Netscape 4.0 and MSIE 4.0.  New option to lynx.cfg
  added:  NCR_IN_BOOKMARKS which is FALSE by default.  - LP
* Tweak "print options menu" to exclude choises which are not available under
  the certain conditions (print to the screen and lpansi on DOS/WINDOWS, print
  to e-mail for local_host_only).  - LP
* Forms options menu:  add a link on option_help.html; synchronize
  option_help.html against Lynx_User_guide.html and lynx.cfg.  Rename label
  "raw 8-bit or CJK Mode" with "CJK Mode" for CJK people and "raw 8-bit" for
  others.  Cleanup postoptions() by introducing flags. - LP
* Force HTuncache_current_document if gen_options() invoked. This is a
  dirty fix until we uncache previous document only when necessary.  - LP
* Add time/date in addition to X-URL and BASE (PrependBaseToSource), (request
  by Hans-Joachim Gurt <gurt@nacamar.net>) - LP
* Turn partial_display off if we are not interactive (reported by Ari Moisio
  <armoi@sci.fi>) - LP
* more fixes/refinements for auto-configuring socks5 on AIX (report by Brian
  Hauber) - TD
1998-08-06 (2.8.1dev.20)
* rename eat_all_cookies to accept_all_cookies everywhere - BJP
* added ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES lines to the dist lynx.cfg with the appropriate
  description - BJP
* added COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAINS to lynx.cfg.  These are
  comma delimited lists of the domains to handle - BJP
* added cookie_add_acceptlist and cookie_add_rejectlist to LYCookie.c, which
  are passed the list of domains from lynx.cfg and add them to the global
  cookie list.  These may be subject to change, as I might not be handling the
  LYstrsep() right -- it works with dev19's LYstrsep(), but hasn't been tested
  with Bela's...  - BJP
* added a big ugly ifdef'd out section to LYrcFile.c with what I have so far on
  the .lynxrc handling of COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS.  Don't use it.  Makes
  nasty segfaults - BJP (Brian J Pardy)
* fix a bug where the DJGPP_KEYHANDLER version doesn't allow movement by arrow
  keys within a text area.  Undo previous patch to LYGetFile.c, with LYgetch
  now changed where it is defined in LYStrings.c, rather than at each place
  where it is used.  The patch in LYStrings.c regarding Windows should fix the
  problem with keymapping that occurred when we got rid of RAWDOSKEYHACK - DK
* turn on DISP_PARTIAL in makefile.dos - DK
* correct typo in LYOptions.c - BL
* corrected logic of LYstrsep - BL
* Few minor typos and forgotten notes in man/hlp/cfg files; also quote Bela's
  note on lynx.cfg INCLUDE facility - LP
* correct typos in makefile.wsl, makefile.dsl - LP
* correct typos, fix character set problems in recent changes of LYOptions.c
  - LP
* move include for socks.h past tcp.h, to allow for redefinition of some
  symbols on AIX (report by Brian Hauber) - TD
* adjust headers so that each can be compiled separately, eliminating order
  dependencies - TD
* include tcp.h always from within HTUtils.h, to enforce ordering of headers
  needed for socks5 definitions - TD
* use S_ISREG, S_ISDIR macros to reduce clutter - TD
* make test for OpenHiddenFile to overwrite user's file more stringent by
  ensuring that the given pathname is not a link from a world-writable
  directory (reported by BL, with suggested patch) - TD
* add/use LYPathLeaf() function to reduce clutter of pathname-leaf parsing - TD
* eliminate redundant definition of 'FREE() - TD
* ifdef'd LYOptions.c to reduce unneeded code wrt --enable-forms-options - TD
* check in OpenHiddenFile to ensure that we overwrite only regular files,
  since we also force the file's permissions to 0600 - TD
1998-07-31 (2.8.1dev.19)
* modify OpenHiddenFile so that it can overwrite files owned by the real
  user if the O_EXCL open fails because the file already exists - TD
* add experimental forms-based options screen (patch by Mike Castle), ifdef'd
  with EXP_FORMS_OPTIONS and configured with --enable-forms-options.
* add option -eat_all_cookies and corresponding config variable
  EAT_ALL_COOKIES (Brian J Pardy <posterkid@psnw.com>).
* correct spurious 'Content' string versus newline after X-URL in LYMail.c
  (Bela Lubkin and LV).
* updated versions of config.guess and config.sub based on automake 1.3 - TD
* updated experimental persistent-cookie support based on RP's patch:  Replaced
  the call to strsep with a home-rolled one for those people who don't have it.
  (Reported by Bela Lubkin, Mon, 27 Jul 1998 16:51:14 -0700 on the mailing
  list.) Bela's modification to make some character arrays static is also
  included.
* nits/spelling in LYPrint.c, LYUtils.c (reported by Mike Castle).
* changed LYGetFile.c to build lynx2.8.1dev.18 with SLANG and the
  DJGPP_KEYHANDLER for DOS - DK
* fix a couple of places where the return-value of calloc was not checked
  (reported by Mike Castle <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com>) - TD
* correct typo in command-line parsing of -lss option (reported by Chris
  Kottaridis <chrisk@BSDI.COM>)
* define _AIX if needed for socks5 (request by Brian Hauber) - TD
* improved configure test for getgroups array type - TD
1998-07-24 (2.8.1dev.18)
* improved test for socks5, to account for special cases on AIX (reported by
  Brian Hauber) - TD
* several changes to reduce the number of gcc cast-qual warnings, by adding
  CONST, removing casts - TD
* add configure option --enable-syslog to enable system logging of requested
  URL's - TD
* add RP's experimental persistent-cookie support, and configure option
  --enable-persistent-cookies, ifdef'd with EXP_PERSISTENT_COOKIES - TD
* removed references to DOSRAWKEYHACK, which is no longer used.  Modified the
  dos makefile for libwww and makefile.dsl to default to using display_partial.
  Modified INSTALLATION to reflect the successful use of slang with the dos
  port and the now confusing alternatives when compiling the dos port, along
  with some other updates - DK
* modify lynx_enable_mouse() for pdcurses configuration so that mouse support
  is disabled unless -use_mouse is specified.  This is ifdef'd with
  __BORLANDC__ for the time being (WB).
* resync build-slang.com, against build.com - TD
* add $(MMSQUALIFIERS) to top-level descrip.mms, e.g., to use options such as
  /FROM, /IGNORE, /NOACTION, etc., and $(INCLUDES) definitions to lower-level
  descrip.mms files.  Improve error-recovery in build.com (patches by Liam
  Davis <ld@stian.demon.co.uk>)
* use memset to clear soc_in fields before doing a connect, needed for BSD/OS
  (patch by Jeffrey C Honig <jch@bsdi.com>).
* remove spurious sprintf params when using FIXED_RECORD_COMMAND_MASK which has
  only one parameter, change VMSsignal from void* to void (report by Mike Xun
  Ma <mike@mira.concordia.ca> ) - TD
* use open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL) to open new hidden files - TD
* eliminate_*putenv_cmd variables used by LYReadCFG.c as placeholders for
  putenv calls - TD
* disable include of <sys/filio.h> for VMS, from report by Chris Doran) - TD
* fixes for VMS: mismatched curly brace, etc., from CTRACE and buffer-overflow
  changes (reported by chris.doran@gblis.mail.abb.com) - TD
* correct a loop in HTML_start_element that strips 7 leading characters from
  an href, fixes a core-dump in traversing ".." to "/" - TD
* use new macro SetOutputMode to reduce some clutter - TD
* modify interface of LYCachedTemp so fileCache member is reset to null, fixes
  bug in my recent cleanup of temp-files, which caused a core-dump - TD
* add kb/sec rate to HTReadProgress message - TD
* modify computation in HTReadProgress to interpolate rate - LP
* One more fix for DISP_PARTIAL: to avoid blinking while reloading document
  with Newline_partial > 1 (say, we press '*' and noproxy) we repaint the page
  only when Newline_partial <= HText_getNumOfLines(). - LP
* add "-verbose" command-line switch. - LP
* DOS fix: open stdout in TEXT mode for -help and startup error message. - LP
* correct use of $mapname variable in CF_ALT_CHAR_SET (Tomas Vanhala)
1998-06-25 (2.8.1dev.17)
* add configure option --with-socks5 (request by Brian Hauber
  <bhauber@frenzy.com>) - TD
* define symbols HAVE_CURSESX_H, HAVE_JCURSES_H (report by Georg Schwarz
  <schwarz@physik.tu-berlin.de>) - TD
* modify logic that reports progress of download to update screen no more than
  once per second, fix an overrun problem (reported by Jacob Poon
  <a324poon@cdf.toronto.edu>) - TD
1998-06-11 (2.8.1dev.16)
* modify configure script to check for special compiler options which are
  assumed for particular platforms (suggested by BL) - TD
* modify display_page in GridText.c so that TRACE does not cause a repaint,
  since that causes colors to be incorrectly rendered when tracing - TD
* fix a few of the signed/unsigned mismatch warnings in GridText.c - TD
* correct pathname in LYOpenScratch call for bookmarks (reported by DK) - TD
* DISP_PARTIAL:  fix initialization of newdoc.line (case LYK_DOWNLOAD,
  mainloop) to correct display while 'd'ownloading files (it was initialized
  _after_ the download completed and was good enough without display_partial
  mode).  - LP
* correct some ifdef's for DISP_PARTIAL - LP
1998-06-04 (2.8.1dev.14)
* minor formatting fixes and documentation for upload screen - LP
* remove config.cache at beginning of configure script - TD
* eliminate cast for GetChar in LYStrings.c (from bug report by Michael Warner,
  analysis by BL) - TD
* shorten logs from WWW/* by disabling echo of compiler options as in src/* -TD
* add configure test for types pid_t and uid_t - TD
* add configure test for array type used in getgroups call, to distinguish
  between BSD and POSIX variations which use different sizes - TD
* modify configure script to compile DISP_PARTIAL code by default - TD
* fix compiler warnings dealing with unreached statements - TD
* change 'keymap[] array to unsigned char, move logic that relies on its size
  into LYKeymap.c - TD
* make LYOpenScratch() work properly for 8.3 names (reported by DK) - TD
* DISP_PARTIAL:  introduce separate variables Newline_partial and
  NumOfLines_partial, initialize them in mainloop and synchronize with Newline
  later when the reload completes (case NORMAL).  To reduce the CPU usage while
  downloading, call HText_pageDisplay only if NumOfLines_partial is in the
  current display page or any Scroll key pressed by the user.  We disable
  partial_display if requested URL have #fragment, otherwise user will see the
  top page first (yes, s/he will be moved to #fragment when the download
  completed, but only if no scroll keys were pressed before!).  Processing of
  "END" key changed from MAXINT to real number of lines in the document
  (important for display_partial mode) - LP.
* correct problem that caused DGJPP version built with slang 1.2.2 to lose its
  socket whenever the rendering of a http URL is interrupted with "z".  This is
  in HTCheckForInterrupt in LYUtils.c (reported by John Lewis) - DK
* add files pdcurses.key, slang.key, djgpp.key to document the keybindings
  used for DJGPP version - DK
* allow mapping of ALT and Function keys with the DOS port for both the
  PDCurses version and the SLANG version with the DJGPP keyhandler.  The
  extended keys to be mapped have to be specified numerically according to the
  definitions in curses.h (for PDCurses) or in keys.h (for SLANG with DJGPP
  keyhandler).  DJGPP maps keys up to 0x293, while PDCurses maps keys up to
  0x1c0 - DK
* don't try to use -std1 option for gcc on Digital Unix (reported by Michael
  Warner <warner@wsu.edu>) - TD
1998-05-23 (2.8.1dev.13)
* use new function LYLocalFileToUrl to cleanup some pathname references - TD
* eliminate 'tempname()' function, using LYNewTxtFile, etc., with new functions
  LYOpenTemp, LYCloseTemp, etc., so that temporary files are opened with
  appropriate permissions - TD
* correct use of cache variable in CF_ALT_CHAR_SET (reported by BL) - TD
* spell out the logic in HTPlain.c against 2.7.2:  there was a certain problem
  with chartrans in text/plain mode (LYRawMode was wrongly interferring,
  problem reported by Jacob Poon & FM).  - LP
* modify logic for zero-width spaces in conv_uni_to_pc to exclude 0x200a - LP
* supply missing "break", which was forcing raw utf-8 output in URLs (NOT hex
  escaped) - LP
1998-05-14 (2.8.1dev.12)
* remove unneeded definition used in testing dev.11 from config.hin) - TD
1998-05-14 (2.8.1dev.11)
* fixes for function-keys with slang configuration on DOS (patch by DK).
* correct missing '&' in command-line options entry for syslog (reported by
  HN) - TD
* correct initial value for NoColorvideo with PDCurses, from my error in
  1998-05-10 integration (reported by DK) - TD
1998-05-10 (2.8.1dev.10)
* eliminate assignment to stderr for trace-file by making tfp a function. - TD
* added John Davis' keymaps/keysym patch (it really should be integrated with
  the normal lynx.cfg file).
* tweak chartrans, "Convert the octet to Unicode":  incoming symbols >127 but <
  LYlowest_eightbit[IN-charset] now ignored, previously displayed as UFFFD.
  (SGML.c, HTPlain.c, LYCharUtils.c) - LP
* removed conflicting/unused declaration of 'bzero()' from tcp.h (from report
  by Ashraf Zorkani <zorkani@aucegypt.edu>) - TD
* modify the set/unset/toggle options to allow "on" and "off" values also - TD
* apply the "partial display" patch, modified from:
      http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0398/msg00993.html
  The behavior is controlled by a compile-time option (DISP_PARTIAL), by a
  command-line argument (-partial), and by a lynx.cfg option (PARTIAL).  - BL
* extend command-line option processing of set/unset/toggle options
      -toggle-     (set that toggle to FALSE)
      -toggle+     (set that toggle to TRUE)
  e.g.,
      lynx -show_cursor+ -case-
  or with explicit 1/0 values, e.g.,
      -toggle=0     (set that toggle to FALSE)
      -toggle=1     (set that toggle to TRUE)
  NOTE:  this allows you to change a few flags that would previously have been
  controlled by lynx.cfg, and are security-related, such as -locexec or
  -telnet.  I believe there is no issue, because if the user can control the
  command line to Lynx, he could have run `lynx -cfg my_cfg_file` and
  circumvented those settings anyway.  - BL
* fix for buffer-overrun in LYMail.c when processing a mailto:very-long-address
  URL - BL
* correct, for OS/2 EMX, a place in LYConvertToURL() which must not use
  HTDOS_wwwName() (patch by Jason F McBrayer <jmcbray@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu>)
* similar changes to LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYStrings.c, add src/makefile.wsl,
  for building DOS version with slang - Bill Schiavo
* modify LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYStrings.c, add src/makefile.dsl, for building
  DOS version with slang - DK
* fix to improve reloading if user changed assume_charset in options menu
  using ^A, which sometimes did not work - LP
* add several chartrans-related files to test/ directory:  spaces.html,
  c1.html, raw8bit.html - LP
* fixes to compile on SunOS with K&R compiler. - TD
1998-05-03 (2.8.1dev.9)
* correct missing counter increment in tempname(), from cleanup. - TD
1998-05-02 (2.8.1dev.8)
* Fix for CGI-related URLs processing (syntax:  ?x=1&yz=2).  To avoid interfere
  with SGML we restrict '=' as terminator for a named entity, this only applied
  for HREF= attribute translation (LYCharUtils.c).  (reported by Alex Matulich
  alex@unicorn.us.com & FM).  - LP
* restore information in the INSTALLATION file for the DOS port on patching
  tcplib.  Also, clarifies the location of nullpkt.  It also clarifies
  that the PDCurses beta has incorporated some of the patches we made for
  the lynx DOS port. - DK
* modify logic that updates bookmark file after removing a link to use copy
  rather than rename, to solve file-ownership problems (patch by Paul
  Gilmartin, though I kept the permissions check). - TD
* reduce a little of the clutter in tempname() with fmt_tempname, and
  bad_tempname functions.  Though this doesn't address the security problems it
  does fix the problem with signed getpid values.  - TD
* simplify LYUtils.c with compare_type() function - TD
* add/use string functions LYLowerCase, LYUpperCase, LYRemoveBlanks (replaces
  collapse_spaces), LYTrimLeading, LYTrimTrailing (incidentally fixes core-dump
  in LYCookie.c) - TD
* rewrite read_cfg function to make it more table-driven (reworked from a
  patch by John Davis) - TD
* rewrite parse_arg function to make it more table-driven (reworked from a
  patch by John Davis) - TD
* omit -Olimit compiler option on Digital UNIX 4.0 (patch by Tomas Vanhala).
* modify configure test for acs_map[] array to work on Digital UNIX 4.0
  (reported by Jim Spath and Tomas Vanhala <vanhala@ling.helsinki.fi>).  - TD
1998-04-23 (2.8.1dev.7)
* fix core-dump when pressing '.' on a page with no links (patch by
  Jan Hlav\'{a}\v{c}ek <lahvak@math.ohio-state.edu>).
* initial changes to use macros CTRACE and tfp to replace explicit use of
  stderr for the trace log.  Remaining work is required for some complex
  expressions, switching file pointers and for perror-substitute. - TD
* ifdef's for OS/2 EMX, mostly pathname tweaks (patch by Jason F. McBrayer
  <jmcbray@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu>).
1998-04-18 (2.8.1dev.6)
* correct misplaced ifdef in LYMail.c, which caused Cc to not work (patch
  by LE).
* convert \x escapes to octal form (reported by Claude Soma). - TD
* modify configure script to check for cursesX before curses library, for
  ultrix 4.3 (reported by Claude Soma <soma_c@decus.fr>). - TD
* incorporate lpansi into LYPrint.c (patch by HN).
* modify top-level makefile to use INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_DATA
  consistently, rather than installbin and installdoc (reported by
  <karl@deas.harvard.edu>).  - TD
* modify treatment of -auth and -pauth options to allow setting a blank
  password, e.g., -pauth=user:  specifies a blank password, and -pauth=user
  leaves the password unspecified (patch by Frederick P Herrmann
  <fph@tiac.net>).
* Change documentation to indicate "Lynx.trace" file rather than "lynx.trace".
* Change default for USE_TRACE_LOG in userdefs.h to TRUE, to make behavior
  consistent with 2.7.2 - TD
* Rename no_color_video symbol in LYCurses.c to NoColorVideo, to avoid conflict
  with term.h, which is included by curses.h on some systems (reported by Paul
  Gilmartin). - TD
* modify include-path in djgpp makefile to avoid conflicting tcp.h - DK
* Add -tagsoup option, for initializing parser directly to TagSoup. - TD
* Modify HTML.c, ifdef'ing some of the logic involved in unstacking tags.  It
  appears to be not completely necessary:  makes Lynx a little faster, at the
  cost of making the tagsoup parser do the wrong thing.  Some entries in the
  tagsoup DTD table versus the sortasgml table have SGML_EMPTY versus
  SGML_MIXED.  This information is used to control unstacking (in the
  color-style configuration as well).  There is still a problem evidenced
  when toggling between the two parsers in the Lynx main help page, but that
  appears to be missing logic in 2.8's version of the tagsoup parser.  - TD
* Modify HTTCP.c to check the length returned from gethostbyname(), which
  returns 0 on error on a SunOS 4 system (reported by Paul Gilmartin). - TD
1998-03-29 (2.8.1dev.5)
* Fixed my typo for FNAMES_8_3 define. WB
* Added SYSTEM_MAIL and SYSTEM_MAIL_FLAGS defines for DOSPATH target. WB
* Better kluge to set terminal type for DOSPATH. WB
* Restored DOSPATH kludge to get to root of directory. WB
* Added a bit of missing _WINDOWS_NSL ifdef'ing. WB
* Minor DOS dirent mod to work with Tom's rearrangements. WB
* Changed #if XYZ to #ifdef XYZ in tcp.h for dumb (?) compilers. WB
1998-03-25 (2.8.1dev.4)
* restore original string in LYUtils.c when user enters a badly formed or
  nonexistent URL when prompted for Goto/history list (patch by Randall
  <hezekiah@may98.rahul.net>).  Otherwise Lynx would always attempt to load a
  local file if the original string omits scheme:// prefix but guessing fails.
* tweak formatting of .message in HTFTP.c so it has leading/trailing blank
  lines (patch by Ismael Cordeiro <ismael@CAM.ORG>)
* retested 'make depend' rule (for LV (Larry Virden)) - TD
* eliminate (except for absolute pathnames, as in VMS) quoted includes - TD
* remove WWW/Library/Implementation/HTAlert.[ch], since they conflict with
  src/HTAlert.[ch], and are not used - TD
* replace the [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE] comments (for images without ALT)
  with filenames of these images.  This feature can be enabled or disabled by
  setting VERBOSE_IMAGES in lynx.cfg and/or userdefs.h (patches by
  helen@voland.cc.huji.ac.il and wschiavo@concentric.net>)
* consistently use ${cf_cv_ncurses_header-curses.h} rather than
  $cf_cv_ncurses_header in configure script, as noted by JS - TD
* tweak include of HTML.h in HTFile.h to fix compile problem on VMS (we really
  should not use quote-style includes) - TD
* fixes to LYStyle.c to make color-style code work on Digital Unix 4.0 - TD
1998-03-20 (2.8.1dev.3)
* Added death for Win/DOS clients that don't have a TMP space defined. - WB
* Added _WINDOWS_NSL to provide interruptable lookups in Win32 per a
  patch from afn06760@afn.org. (modified hopefully for borland AND cygwin and
  hard defined in tcp.h).  I had to recompile everything in multithread
  mode for borland, including my zlib library. - WB
* Added _WINDOWS as a target for FNAMES_8_3 in userdefs.h to allow for 16
  bit helper apps that can't handle LFN's. (report by afn06760@afn.org) - WB
1998-03-18 (2.8.1dev.1)
* correct an ifdef that caused inconsistent pathname separators on Windows
  (reported by afn, patch by DK).
* correct a missing AC_MSG_RESULT in configure.in (also MM) - TD
* guard against illegal (e.g., zero) value for DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE, when it is
  read from lynx.cfg (reported by Martin Mokrejs
  <mmokrejs@prfdec.natur.cuni.cz>) - TD
* implement simple 'include' facility for lynx.cfg - BL
* change TagClass and TagFlags to #define's to accommodate older compilers
  which do not accept initialization of enums from data that do not correspond
  to the declared values, e.g., CLIX (which complains) and Apollo (which fails
  to compile, reported by Dave Eaton).  - TD
* remove some obsolete definitions from userdefs.h, tcp.h and HTUtils.h - TD
* remove obsolete files from WWW/Library - TD
1998-03-12
* UPPER8: a separate function HTMLSetDisplayCharsetMatchLocale() introduced
  (LYCharSets.c). Locale mismatch assumed for DOS/WINDOWS display charsets. -LP
