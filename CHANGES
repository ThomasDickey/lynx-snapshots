Changes since Lynx 2.8 release
================================================================================

1998-05-23 (2.8.1dev.13)
* use new function LYLocalFileToUrl to cleanup some pathname references - TD
* eliminate 'tempname()' function, using LYNewTxtFile, etc., with new functions
  LYOpenTemp, LYCloseTemp, etc., so that temporary files are opened with
  appropriate permissions - TD
* correct use of cache variable in CF_ALT_CHAR_SET (reported by BL) - TD
* spell out the logic in HTPlain.c against 2.7.2:  there was a certain problem
  with chartrans in text/plain mode (LYRawMode was wrongly interferring,
  problem reported by Jacob Poon & FM).  - LP
* modify logic for zero-width spaces in conv_uni_to_pc to exclude 0x200a - LP
* supply missing "break", which was forcing raw utf-8 output in URLs (NOT hex
  escaped) - LP
1998-05-14 (2.8.1dev.12)
* remove unneeded definition used in testing dev.11 from config.hin) - TD
1998-05-14 (2.8.1dev.11)
* fixes for function-keys with slang configuration on DOS (patch by DK).
* correct missing '&' in command-line options entry for syslog (reported by
  HN) - TD
* correct initial value for NoColorvideo with PDCurses, from my error in
  1998-05-10 integration (reported by DK) - TD
1998-05-10 (2.8.1dev.10)
* eliminate assignment to stderr for trace-file by making tfp a function. - TD
* added John Davis' keymaps/keysym patch (it really should be integrated with
  the normal lynx.cfg file).
* tweak chartrans, "Convert the octet to Unicode":  incoming symbols >127 but <
  LYlowest_eightbit[IN-charset] now ignored, previously displayed as UFFFD.
  (SGML.c, HTPlain.c, LYCharUtils.c) - LP
* removed conflicting/unused declaration of 'bzero()' from tcp.h (from report
  by Ashraf Zorkani <zorkani@aucegypt.edu>) - TD
* modify the set/unset/toggle options to allow "on" and "off" values also - TD
* apply the "partial display" patch, modified from:  
      http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0398/msg00993.html  
  The behavior is controlled by a compile-time option (DISP_PARTIAL), by a
  command-line argument (-partial), and by a lynx.cfg option (PARTIAL).  - BL
* extend command-line option processing of set/unset/toggle options 
      -toggle-     (set that toggle to FALSE) 
      -toggle+     (set that toggle to TRUE) 
  e.g.,
      lynx -show_cursor+ -case- 
  or with explicit 1/0 values, e.g.,
      -toggle=0     (set that toggle to FALSE) 
      -toggle=1     (set that toggle to TRUE)  
  NOTE:  this allows you to change a few flags that would previously have been
  controlled by lynx.cfg, and are security-related, such as -locexec or
  -telnet.  I believe there is no issue, because if the user can control the
  command line to Lynx, he could have run `lynx -cfg my_cfg_file` and
  circumvented those settings anyway.  - BL
* fix for buffer-overrun in LYMail.c when processing a mailto:very-log-address
  URL - BL
* correct, for OS/2 EMX, a place in LYConvertToURL() which must not use
  HTDOS_wwwName() (patch by Jason F. McBrayer <jmcbray@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu>)
* similar changes to LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYStrings.c, add src/makefile.wsl, for building
  DOS version with slang - Bill Schiavo
* modify LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYStrings.c, add src/makefile.dsl, for building
  DOS version with slang - DK
* fix to improve reloading if user changed assume_charset in options menu
  using ^A, which sometimes did not work - LP
* add several chartrans-related files to test/ directory:  spaces.html,
  c1.html, raw8bit.html - LP
* fixes to compile on SunOS with K&R compiler. - TD
1998-05-03 (2.8.1dev.9)
* correct missing counter increment in tempname(), from cleanup. - TD
1998-05-02 (2.8.1dev.8)
* Fix for CGI-related URLs processing (syntax:  ?x=1&yz=2).  To avoid interfere
  with SGML we restrict '=' as terminator for a named entity, this only applied
  for HREF= attribute translation (LYCharUtils.c).  (reported by Alex Matulich
  alex@unicorn.us.com & FM).  - LP
* restore information in the INSTALLATION file for the DOS port on patching
  tcplib.  Also, clarifies the location of nullpkt.  It also clarifies
  that the PDCurses beta has incorporated some of the patches we made for
  the lynx DOS port. - DK
* modify logic that updates bookmark file after removing a link to use copy
  rather than rename, to solve file-ownership problems (patch by Paul
  Gilmartin, though I kept the permissions check). - TD
* reduce a little of the clutter in tempname() with fmt_tempname, and
  bad_tempname functions.  Though this doesn't address the security problems it
  does fix the problem with signed getpid values.  - TD
* simplify LYUtils.c with compare_type() function - TD
* add/use string functions LYLowerCase, LYUpperCase, LYRemoveBlanks (replaces
  collapse_spaces), LYTrimLeading, LYTrimTrailing (incidentally fixes core-dump
  in LYCookie.c) - TD
* rewrite read_cfg function to make it more table-driven (reworked from a
  patch by John Davis) - TD
* rewrite parse_arg function to make it more table-driven (reworked from a
  patch by John Davis) - TD
* omit -Olimit compiler option on Digital UNIX 4.0 (patch by Tomas Vanhala).
* modify configure test for acs_map[] array to work on Digital UNIX 4.0
  (reported by Jim Spath and Tomas Vanhala <vanhala@ling.helsinki.fi>).  - TD
1998-04-23 (2.8.1dev.7)
* fix core-dump when pressing '.' on a page with no links (patch by
  Jan Hlav\'{a}\v{c}ek <lahvak@math.ohio-state.edu>).
* initial changes to use macros CTRACE and tfp to replace explicit use of
  stderr for the trace log.  Remaining work is required for some complex
  expressions, switching file pointers and for perror-substitute. - TD
* ifdef's for OS/2 EMX, mostly pathname tweaks (patch by Jason F. McBrayer
  <jmcbray@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu>).
1998-04-18 (2.8.1dev.6)
* correct misplaced ifdef in LYMail.c, which caused Cc to not work (patch
  by LE).
* convert \x escapes to octal form (reported by Claude Soma). - TD
* modify configure script to check for cursesX before curses library, for
  ultrix 4.3 (reported by Claude Soma <soma_c@decus.fr>). - TD
* incorporate lpansi into LYPrint.c (patch by HN).
* modify top-level makefile to use INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_DATA
  consistently, rather than installbin and installdoc (reported by
  <karl@deas.harvard.edu>).  - TD
* modify treatment of -auth and -pauth options to allow setting a blank
  password, e.g., -pauth=user:  specifies a blank password, and -pauth=user
  leaves the password unspecified (patch by Frederick P Herrmann
  <fph@tiac.net>).
* Change documentation to indicate "Lynx.trace" file rather than "lynx.trace".
* Change default for USE_TRACE_LOG in userdefs.h to TRUE, to make behavior
  consistent with 2.7.2 - TD
* Rename no_color_video symbol in LYCurses.c to NoColorVideo, to avoid conflict
  with term.h, which is included by curses.h on some systems (reported by Paul
  Gilmartin). - TD
* modify include-path in djgpp makefile to avoid conflicting tcp.h - DK
* Add -tagsoup option, for initializing parser directly to TagSoup. - TD
* Modify HTML.c, ifdef'ing some of the logic involved in unstacking tags.  It
  appears to be not completely necessary:  makes Lynx a little faster, at the
  cost of making the tagsoup parser do the wrong thing.  Some entries in the
  tagsoup DTD table versus the sortasgml table have SGML_EMPTY versus
  SGML_MIXED.  This information is used to control unstacking (in the
  color-style configuration as well).  There is still a problem evidenced
  when toggling between the two parsers in the Lynx main help page, but that
  appears to be missing logic in 2.8's version of the tagsoup parser.  - TD
* Modify HTTCP.c to check the length returned from gethostbyname(), which
  returns 0 on error on a SunOS 4 system (reported by Paul Gilmartin). - TD
1998-03-29 (2.8.1dev.5)
* Fixed my typo for FNAMES_8_3 define. WB
* Added SYSTEM_MAIL and SYSTEM_MAIL_FLAGS defines for DOSPATH target. WB
* Better kluge to set terminal type for DOSPATH. WB
* Restored DOSPATH kludge to get to root of directory. WB
* Added a bit of missing _WINDOWS_NSL ifdef'ing. WB
* Minor DOS dirent mod to work with Tom's rearrangements. WB
* Changed #if XYZ to #ifdef XYZ in tcp.h for dumb (?) compilers. WB
1998-03-25 (2.8.1dev.4)
* restore original string in LYUtils.c when user enters a badly formed or
  nonexistent URL when prompted for Goto/history list (patch by Randall
  <hezekiah@may98.rahul.net>).  Otherwise Lynx would always attempt to load a
  local file if the original string omits scheme:// prefix but guessing fails.
* tweak formatting of .message in HTFTP.c so it has leading/trailing blank
  lines (patch by Ismael Cordeiro <ismael@CAM.ORG>)
* retested 'make depend' rule (for Larry Virden) - TD
* eliminate (except for absolute pathnames, as in VMS) quoted includes - TD
* remove WWW/Library/Implementation/HTAlert.[ch], since they conflict with
  src/HTAlert.[ch], and are not used - TD
* replace the [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE] comments (for images without ALT)
  with filenames of these images.  This feature can be enabled or disabled by
  setting VERBOSE_IMAGES in lynx.cfg and/or userdefs.h (patches by
  helen@voland.cc.huji.ac.il and wschiavo@concentric.net>)
* consistently use ${cf_cv_ncurses_header-curses.h} rather than
  $cf_cv_ncurses_header in configure script, as noted by JS - TD
* tweak include of HTML.h in HTFile.h to fix compile problem on VMS (we really
  should not use quote-style includes) - TD
* fixes to LYStyle.c to make color-style code work on Digital Unix 4.0 - TD
1998-03-20 (2.8.1dev.3)
* Added death for Win/DOS clients that don't have a TMP space defined. - WB
* Added _WINDOWS_NSL to provide interruptable lookups in Win32 per a
  patch from afn06760@afn.org. (modified hopefully for borland AND cygwin and
  hard defined in tcp.h).  I had to recompile everything in multithread
  mode for borland, including my zlib library. - WB
* Added _WINDOWS as a target for FNAMES_8_3 in userdefs.h to allow for 16
  bit helper apps that can't handle LFN's. (report by afn06760@afn.org) - WB
1998-03-18 (2.8.1dev.1)
* correct an ifdef that caused inconsistent pathname separators on Windows
  (reported by afn, patch by DK).
* correct a missing AC_MSG_RESULT in configure.in (also MM) - TD
* guard against illegal (e.g., zero) value for DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE, when it is
  read from lynx.cfg (reported by Martin Mokrejs
  <mmokrejs@prfdec.natur.cuni.cz>) - TD
* implement simple 'include' facility for lynx.cfg - BL
* change TagClass and TagFlags to #define's to accommodate older compilers
  which do not accept initialization of enums from data that do not correspond
  to the declared values, e.g., CLIX (which complains) and Apollo (which fails
  to compile, reported by Dave Eaton).  - TD
* remove some obsolete definitions from userdefs.h, tcp.h and HTUtils.h - TD
* remove obsolete files from WWW/Library - TD
1998-03-12
* UPPER8: a separate function HTMLSetDisplayCharsetMatchLocale() introduced
  (LYCharSets.c). Locale mismatch assumed for DOS/WINDOWS display charsets. - LP
