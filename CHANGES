* Added the ability to set the advanced mode for multiple bookmarks from
  the options menu and save the defaults in the .lynxrc file - HL
* Various typo corrections including one which kept LYMainLoop.c from
  compiling under unix when DIRED_SUPPORT was defined. - HL
11-29-96
* Numerous additional refinements and enhancements of the multiple bookmark
  support.  Added support for REFRESH and PREV_DOC in the options and bookmark
  menus, and NEXT_PAGE, PREV_PAGE, and ACTIVATE in the bookmark menus or
  prompts.  Expanded the anchor and document structures to keep track of
  different bookmark files in conjunction with VIEW_BOOKMARK, ADD_BOOKMARK,
  and DEL_BOOKMARK commands, to restore the proper bookmark files on reloads
  (overt, or because the cache was dumped for subsequent documents accessed
  via bookmark links), and in conjunction with security-related restrictions.
  Multiple bookmark support can be regulated via MULTI_BOOKMARK_SUPPORT,
  BLOCK_MULTI_BOOKMARKS and ADVANCED_MULTI_BOOKMARKS symbols in userdefs.h
  (or as SITE_DEFS in the Makefile) and lynx.cfg.  The multiple bookmark
  support can be blocked via a -restrictions=multibook command line switch,
  which is also set for -anonymous and -validate.  Prompting or display of
  the bookmark file selection menu occurs only if bookmark files in addition
  to the startup default have been defined (via the B)ookmark command in the
  'o'ptions menu, if mu(L)ti bookmarks has been turned on; the setting and
  definitions can be saved in the .lynxrc file).  Plugged memory leaks in
  the previous implementation of multiple bookmark support.  Added code for
  inserting the current description and filepath for each bookmark file
  dynamically during rendering. - FM
* Another tweak of attribute order in HTMLDTD.c. - KW
11-28-96
* Tweaked multiple bookmark support to fix an error which was causing a
  crash on some systems and incorrect behavior on others - HL
* Tweaked editing of multiple bookmark filenames to correct shifting of 
  screen between multiple pages - HL
11-26-96
* Added support for setting the rendering of SELECT OPTIONs as popup menus
  versus radio button lists via the 'o'ptions menu, and saving the default
  in the RC file.  Changed NO_SELECT_POPUPS to USE_SELECT_POPUPS in lynx.cfg
  and userdefs.h.  The -popup switch still overrides everything. - FM
* Added multiple bookmark support along the lines of the patch from Filip M.
  Gieszczykiewicz (filipg@paranoia.com), plus numerous enhancements of the
  'o'ptions menu and bookmark handling. - FM
* Tweaks of attribute orders in HTMLDTD.h and HTMLDTD.c. - KW
11-25-96
* Updated the "Lynx Enhanced Pages" links to the new "Lynx links"
  (http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html) throughout the help, docs,
  and code. - FM 
11-24-96
* Modified the ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" handling to indicate the
  Content-Type with charset parameter, when known, within each part
  rather than in the main Content-Type header. - FM
* Corrected typo in HTNews.c. - FM
* Added support for setting the suggested filename in 'd'ownload and
  'p'rint options based on the Content-Disposition header if it included
  the string  file; filename=name.suffix  in its value.  Can be used by
  CGI scripts to set the suggested filename for saves to disk, downloads
  or mailings of the script's reply body, so it won't be the last symbolic
  element in the path field of the form's ACTION (which is normally the
  the script, itself, or a PATH_INFO element, and thus misleading). - FM 
* Tweaks of change_sug_filename() in LYUtils.c for better handling of
  gzipped files on VMS. - FM
11-23-96
* Added reporting of the Server, Date and Last-Modified headers, if present
  in server replies, to the showinfo ('=') display. - FM
* Added the ability to store the NO_SELECT_POPUPS in the .lynxrc, but the
  .lynxrc must be edited manually until the options handling is converted
  to a form-like interface that accommodates more options.  For now, select
  'O'ptions and write out the options with '>' to create a block in .lynxrc
  with an explanation of the switch.  The switch is "select_popups" and
  can have the values of "on", "off", or nothing.  If nothing, the default
  set in userdefs.h or lynx.cfg will persist.  Otherwise, "on" will set use
  of popups and "off" will set use of radio buttons as the default.  The
  startup default always can be toggled via the -popup switch. - HL & FM
* Corrected a couple of typos in the help files. - HL
11-22-96
* Added support for WHEREIS ('/') and 'n'ext searches within SELECT popups.
  The buffering for 'n'ext is separate from that in the main loop (i.e.,
  for non-form field document searches), but all previously entered search
  strings are still combined into a circular buffer and can be accessed via
  the up-arrow or down-arrow keys at the prompt for a search string.  The
  searches within popup menus do not yield highlighting of the search string,
  but simply positioning of the cursor on successive options which contain
  the search string. - FM
* Added support for all of the navigation commands within SELECT popup
  windows, including HOME, END, UP_TWO, DOWN_TWO, UP_HALF and DOWN_HALF,
  in addition to the single line and paging navigation commands. - FM
* Added support for the REFRESH command within SELECT popup windows. - FM
* Tweak of hookless snews handling. - FM
11-21-96
* Added handling of forms with ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data".  Note that
  we still don't support INPUTs with TYPE="file" or TYPE="range", and
  thus still set the DISABLED attribute for all fields in the form if
  either of those two TYPEs are present in it. - FM
* Tweak of -mime_header handling. - FM
* Typo fixes of comments in HTML.c. - Albert S Woodhull
  (aswNS@hamp.hampshire.edu)
11-20-96
* Added a NO_SELECT_POPUPS compilation (userdefs.h) and configuration
  (lynx.cfg) definition, normally set FALSE.  If set TRUE, single-choice
  SELECT blocks (i.e., ones without the MULTIPLE attribute) will be handled
  as a list of radio buttons instead of via a popup window.  Also added a
  -popup command line switch for toggling the compilation or configuration
  setting. - FM
11-18-96
* Tweak of LYFindEndOfComment() in LYCharUtils.c. - Brian Borowski
  (brianb@braille.uwo.ca)
11-17-96
* Added links to the lynx-dev hypertext archive at FLORA in the online
  'h'elp. - FM
* Tweaks of my_spawn() in LYLocal.c. - KW
11-16-96
* Added support for use of the 'd'ownload command on TYPE="submit" and
  TYPE="image" submit buttons.  You still must use the History Page for
  TYPE="text" INPUT fields that also act as submit buttons by virtue of
  being the only non-hidden field, because the 'd'ownload command key
  could be a text entry into the field, and thus must be treated as
  such. - FM 
11-15-96
* Mods of HTFormat.c and HTTP.c for better handling of unexpected server
  disconnects. - FM
11-13-96
* Wind down the element stack on EOF if any unclosed tags were received. - FM
* Fixed typos in the HTMLDTD.c BODYTEXT definitions. - FM
11-10-96
* More tweaks of hook-less snews handling. - FM
* Changed the default STARTFILE to http://lynx.browser.org/ and the default
  HELPFILE to the v2.6 set at NYU in userdefs.h and lynx.cfg. - FM
* New function HTUnEscapeSome() in HTParse.c for unescaping selected
  characters in a string.. - KW
* Numerous changes to make DIRED_SUPPORT work as intended, to use the
  library's HTList functions and macros for managing the list of tagged
  file URLs, and to keep track of proper levels of URL escaping so that
  unusual filenames which contain #% etc. are handled properly.  Can now
  edit, move, etc. Abc%25252525def.html, #xy#~, etc. - KW
11-09-96
* Treat 301 or 302 redirection of a POST as 303 when the Lynx process is
  non-interactive, rather than rejecting the redirection, since 303 is
  still most likely what the CGI script actually intends (will still
  prompt if the process is interactive). - FM
* Added parsing and trace mode reporting of Content-Disposition headers
  in HTMIME.c (should be used, someday, to set the suggested file name
  for disk saves and downloads based on any filename=foo.blah field). - FM
* Further mods of HTNews.c to facilitate use of Lynx without SSL-hooks
  in conjunction with an SSL-capable daemon/proxy for snews URLs that
  returns NNTP streams for Lynx itself to convert into HTML, instead
  of already converted streams as from a standard proxy. - TZ & FM
11-08-96
* Changed information returned by "-version" in LYMain.c to point to
  lynx.browser.org and added a date to the copyright info. - HL
11-07-96
* Mods of HTNews.c to facilitate use of Lynx without SSL-hooks in
  conjunction with an SSL-capable daemon/proxy for snews URLs. - TZ
11-05-96
* Typo fixes in HTMIME.c. - KW
* Tweak of NSL_FORK mods. - FM
11-04-96
* Tweaks of host parsing when a password and/or username is present
  in override_proxy() of HTAccess.c. - FM
* Tweaks of the UNDERSCORES and STARS macro setup and useage to avoid
  possible crashes for FORMs with long values. - FM
* Worked in Tom Zerucha's (tz@execpc.com) code for fork-based name
  server lookups that can be 'z'apped.  May not yet be portable to
  all flavors of Unix.  Add -DNSL_FORK to your SITE_LYDEFS to try
  it. - FM
11-02-96
* Fixed typo in HTAlert.h. - FM
* Cleaned up HTTCP.c code, simplified some of its spaghetti
  ifdef'ing, and worked in mods to bypass connection confirmations
  when Lynx is SOCKSified and the socks_flag is set. - FM
* Added recognition and acceptance of text/x-sgml and text/sgml
  MIME types (all that I've encountered thus far work fine with
  Lynx, though it doesn't yet interpret marked sections). - FM
* Added socket function prototypes for MultiNet in tcp.h. - FM
* Mods to facilitate application of the SSL patches (after some
  corrections in the patches to keep HTLoadHTTP re-entrant, make
  CONNECT work as intended again, and eliminate memory leaks in
  the SSLeay adaption) - FM
* Adding info about -DNO_TTYTYPE in top level Makefile. - FM
* Use clrtoeol() in LYOptions.c to ensure that no terminals which use
  reverse video for standout() will have trailing reverse fields on
  edits of option vaules. - DK
* Offer user@host instead of WebMaster@host for the 'c'omment command
  if the path for the URL begins with a tilde and there is no
  LINK REV="made" present. - FM
* Tweaks of inews Makefile and clientlib.c. - Christopher R. Maden
  (crm@ebt.com)
* Check nhist before attempting a DIRED_SUPPORT directory listing in
  LYShowInfo.c. - KW
10-21-96
* Offer WebMaster@host for the 'c'omment command if no LINK REV="made"
  was present in a text/html document, and save a known owner URL when
  toggling to source ('\') so that the 'c'omment command can still be
  used with that owner's (mailto or homepage) URL, but the source can
  be included in the comment, as would be desireable (instead of a bad
  rendering) when sending a comment about bad HTML in the document. - FM
10-20-96
* Added code for traversing the pseudo-documents created for client-side
  image MAPs.  See the updated CRAWL.announce for more information. - FM
10-19-96
* Added definitions in LYCurses.h relating curses function calls to slang
  functions or emulations for compatibility with new versions of slang,
  based on patch from John E. Davis (davis@space.mit.edu). - FM
* Added unescaping of the full address fields in mailto URLs or ACTIONs,
  and improved the reliability of the parsing of the subject header from
  the ?searchpart Netscapism when present. - FM
* Give user option to use 303-like coversion of POST to GET in confirmation
  requests for redirection of POSTs, base on patches from Drazen Kacar
  (dave@fly.cc.fer.hr). - FM
* Tweaks of POST content submissions in HTTP.c, based on patch from
  KW. - FM
* Fixed EOF checks in HTAAFile.c, HTGroup.c and HTPasswd.c, and improved
  host address parsing in HTTCP.c, based on patches from Larry Schwimmer
  (schwim@cyclone.stanford.edu) and Klaus Weide (kweide@tezcat.com). - FM
* Added targets for umaxv and umaxv-slang for Encore's UMAXV - Thanh Ma
  (tma@encore.com)
10-16-96
* Send the rendering of decompressed files to stdout with -dump, don't
  spawn a viewer under any circumstances if -dump was used instead of
  -source for Content-Types that are not text/html, and remove the
  temporary decompressed files before exiting with -dump or -source. - FM
* Properly handle TYPE="radio" versus TYPE="checkbox" INPUTs with NULL
  or zero-length VALUEs. - FM
* Added a continuation line token for the netbsd-ncurses target - HL
* Fixed a typo in HTMIME.c in the trace output - HL
* Block predictable buffer overrun in GridText.c if a page has more
  than MAXLINKS links in it. - FM
10-01-96
* Add a Mime-Version header to the other headers in LYPrint.c so that the
  09-20-96 mods for mailing source do what they were intended to do. :) -
  Hamish MacEwan (macewanh@diatp.dia.govt.nz)
09-20-96
* Add a BASE tag to the tops of HTML source files, a la Netscape, when
  mailing or downloading, and don't worry, for now, if that creates
  technically invalid HTML (since Lynx copes with it as of the 09-15-96
  mods 8-). - FM
* Include Content-Type, Content-Location and Content-Base headers when
  mailing HTML source on Unix. - FM
* Use .txt versus .html suffixes when submitting rendered versus HTML source
  temporary files to VMS MAIL, so that transports such as PMDF will indicate
  the appropriate Content-Type. - FM
09-17-96
* Handle illegally positioned BASE tags. - FM
* Tweak of Q nesting level checks. - Pawel Wiecek
  (coven@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl)
* Fixed typo in HTMIME.c for parsing of Pragma header. - Wilson Cheung
  (wcheung@netcom.com)
* Added parsing of Set-Cookie header in HTMIME.c (see IETF ID
  http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-03.txt
  for info on how to implement it's use). - FM
* Fixed typo in LYMainLoop.c for display of error message when up arrow is
  pressed at the top of a document. - Hiram Lester, Jr. (hwlester@pobox.com)
09-16-96
* Use standard ls -l parsing of LIST output for Windows_NT ftp servers in
  Lynx v2.6 as in v2.5. - FM
