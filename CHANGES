Changes since Lynx 2.8.1 release
================================================================================

1998-11-21 (2.8.2dev.6)
+ add call on dbug_init to LYMain.c, allowing use of the debugging code built
  into the WATTCP code which is included in the DJGPP port of lynx.  This is
  activated by placing lines in the WATTCP.CFG file for:
    DEBUG.MODE= (choices are HEADERS, DUMP, or ALL)
    DEBUG.PROTO= (choices are TCP, UDP, or  ALL)
    DEBUG.FILE= (name of log file. Defaults to WATTCP.DBG)
  This adds about 2K to the size of the stripped, compressed executable.  You
  get a log of the headers and/or a binary dump of the packets sent and
  received.  Maybe this will help in determining where ftp is failing in this
  port - DK
* correct definitions for ANSI_VARARGS, HAVE_STDARG_H in HTUtils.h (reported
  by LP, for djgpp) - TD
* correct logic in StrAllocVsprintf(), remove spurious test on dst_len
  (analysis by LV) - TD
1998-11-21 (2.8.2dev.5)
* modify HTLoadFile() to make compressed files work with OS/2 EMX and
  LYSystem() to convert forward slashes in pathnames to backslashes, also for
  EMX (patches by Ilya Zakharevich).
* documentation nits (apostrophes) in lynx.cfg and userdefs.h - LV
* fix inconsistent newlines in po/it.po (report by Irving_Wolfe@Wolfe.net) - TD
* modify config.guess, added Intergraph 2430 CLIX machines (reported by Alex
  Matulich <matuli_a@marlin.navsea.navy.mil>) - TD
* minor fix in LYCharSets.c according to recent changes in UCDefs.h introduced
  by IBM OS/2 codepage number - LP
* modify configure script to work with --enable-nls built into a subdirectory
  of the source tree (reported by PG) - TD
* disable regeneration of intl/po2tbl.sed and po/POTFILES if --disable-nls
  configure option is specified - TD
* add configure test for stdarg.h vs varargs.h - TD
* fixes to work with SunOS K&R compiler - TD
* don't trim trailing and leading spaces from unformatted text lines in some
  cases (split_line in GridText.c).  Prevents corruption of some uuencoded
  files when they are displayed and then 'P'rinted (although 'D'ownload should
  be used instead) - KW
* some changes in HText_appendCharacter (GridText.c).  Splitting of long SOURCE
  lines now works with color styles - KW
* workaround for multiple anchors in the same (invalid) HTML document with the
  same NAME and different destinations (HTAnchor.c) - KW
* check for 'z'ap while constructing local directory listings (non-VMS only, in
  HTFile.c) - KW
* added a couple outofmem checks (HTAnchor.c).  Minor TRACE message change in
  GridText.c for -tlog / USE_TRACE_LOG disabled - KW
* when adding bookmark entries, don't accept a title string which appears to
  consist only of blank characters (LYBookmark.c).  When rendering a bookmark
  file, use hiddenlinks=merge counting, so that numbers after entries with
  empty titles don't get out of whack (GridText.c).  This should prevent 'R'
  from removing the wrong bookmark entry - KW
* prevent generation of some unnecessary temp files when constructing mailcap
  file test commands (HTInit.c) - KW
* include LYLeaks.h in UCdomap.c for memory leak detection - KW
* fixed various memory leaks (UCdomap.c, LYShowInfo.c, LYReadCFG.c, LYMain.c,
  LYDownload.c, LYBookmark.c, HTML.c, DefaultStyle.c) - KW
* escape '&' and '<' in HTML generated to display current lynx.cfg option
  values (LYReadCFG.c) - KW
* revert logic in split_line.  Emphasis highlighting that should extend over
  several lines was being lost at line breaks (GridText.c).  (IsSpecialAttrChar
  probably shouldn't return true for LY_SOFT_NEWLINE since in most places it
  tests whether to skip a character position, but as long as this special char
  is only used in SOURCE mode it cannot mess up any anchor positions so it
  should be ok.  - KW
* correct character counting in SOURCE display continuation lines.  A
  highlighted search target would be shown shifted left by one character
  position because the LY_SOFT_NEWLINE special was displayed as '+' but not
  counted (GridText.c) - KW
* prevent generation of invalid/unparseable comments if
  UCSaveBookmarksInUnicode is in effect, other minor changes in
  LYBookmark.c - KW
* correction for color styles in HText_appendCharacter (GridText.c).  At some
  point a memmove was replaced by a for loop, but source and destination were
  reversed and the counter was wrong - KW
* modify HTSprintf/HTSprintf0 to use a more generic approach to varargs by
  using only va_alist in the parameter list - TD
* correct html expression in LYShowInfo.c of dev.3 which did not allow the temp
  file with the lynx.cfg settings to be accessed from the Configuration
  Definitions page (patch by Ismael Cordeiro).
* correct "Exiting" message format in cleanup_sig(), which had unexpanded %d
  (reported by BJP) - TD
* add to config.hin the definitions set by AM_GNU_GETTEXT macro (PG pointed
  out that this also sets 'inline', needed for GNU gettext) - TD
* modify MakeNewTitle() to check for null pointer, fixing core dump with
  verbose images when value[src_type] is null (reported by John Bley
  <jbb6@acpub.duke.edu> for 2.8.1rel.2) - TD
1998-11-18 (2.8.2dev.4)
* change default for configure option of NLS (gettext) to disabled until we
  finish porting it to implementations other than GNU gettext.  Also,
  change default for include-gettext configure option to "with" - TD
* suppress cookie-storing if the value is null - BJP
* ifdef'd alternative set of line-edit bindings with EXP_ALT_BINDINGS, add
  configure option --enable-alt-bindings, rename DELEOL to DELEL, remove
  binding of DELEL to '\'. - TD
* add alternative set of line-edit bindings to change the behavior of the ^B
  and ^F line editor bindings to provide emacs/tcsh like behavior (cursor
  left/right), instead of "word" deletes.  Corrected a bug in the ^R (LYE_DELN)
  function, which is described as "delete next character", but was in fact
  performing identically to ^D (LYE_DELC) "delete current character".  Added a
  function called LYE_DELEL, which does the expected thing, and deletes
  from the current cursor position, to the EOL.
  New bindings:
    ^B = LYE_BACK   cursor backwards
    ^F = LYE_FORW   cursor forwards
    ^K = LYE_DELEOL delete to end-of-line
    ^T = LYE_DELNW  delete next word
    ^X = LYE_DELPW  delete previous word
    ^^ = LYE_UPPER  upper case line (not active when kbd-layout binding is)
    ^_ = LYE_LOWER  lower case line
  (Kim DeVaughn <kimdv@best.com>).
* modify to show address to submit to on the statusline when in advanced user
  mode.  Also fixes one small typo in LYMainLoop.c.  (suggested by
  <erisson@sw-tech.com>) - BJP
* modify HTParseInet() so that it works if stdin has been redirected to
  /dev/null, e.g., when running a cron job (reported by John H.  DuBois III
  <spcecdt@armory.com>) - BL
* minor documentation updates to lynx.cfg (Larry Virden).
* change some character constants from '\hex' and '\octal' form to decimal,
  to pursuade compilers that upper-128 compares are legal - TD
* ifdef'd KEYBOARD_LAYOUT with EXP_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT, add configure option
  --enable-kbd-layout - TD
* implement EXP_CHARTRANS_AUTOSWITCH for OS/2 EMX (Sergey Svishchev).
* add 'a' response when printing a file to allow append rather than overwrite
  (Sergey Svishchev).
* add KEYBOARD_LAYOUT to lynx.cfg, to support character-translation on input,
  add missing line editing style selection to Options form.  This is enabled
  and disabled by the line edit control/uparrow (Sergey Svishchev
  <svs@ropnet.ru>).
* use exit_immediately() to reduce some signal-function clutter - LP
* correct dependency in src/makefile.in for cfg_defs.h (Masashi Fujita
  <objectx@bandit.co.jp>)
* change quoted includes in intl directory to bracketed includes - TD
1998-11-16 (2.8.2dev.3)
* misc documentation updates for the gettext/internationalization - LP
* rename po/makefile.in.in to po/makefile.inn, and modify distclean rule to
  remove the remaining generated files - TD
+ add preliminary changes from PG (pg@sweng.stortek.com) to support port to
  OS/390, some ifdef'd with __MVS__, some with EBCDIC and NOT_ASCII.
* modify LYCookies.c to accept cookies with no value, in case the site resets a
  cookie by nulling out the value (reported by Larry Virden) - BJP
* modify cookie parsing to ignore comment lines beginning with a '#' (reported
  by Jonathan Bobin indicates that Netscape adds comments back, confusing Lynx)
  - BJP
* highlight option letters in old options screen (adapted from patch by Ismael
  Cordeiro) - TD
* use HTSprintf functions in HText_SubmitForm(), user_message(),
  LYLoadIMGmap(), HTTelnet.c.  (The HTTelnet.c modifications fix a security
  hole reported by Martin Mokrejs) - TD
* add HTSprintf, HTSprintf0 functions, to use in resolving potential buffer
  overflows - TD
* modify HTVMS_purge() to rename the remaining file to version 1 unless a
  permissions problem was encountered - TD
1998-11-10 (2.8.2dev.2)
* some testing against Solaris gettext implementation, enough to see that it is
  not really compatible either source or binary with GNU gettext.  For the time
  being, I recommend building NLS support only with GNU gettext (and
  --with-included-gettext to avoid conflict with Solaris' gettext in the
  standard library).  Otherwise use the --disable-nls configure option - TD
* various changes to configure script and makefiles to make this build with and
  without NLS - TD
* undo spurious substitutions such as gettext("") - TD
* modify some gettext() expressions to avoid embedding HTML in them - TD
* restore definitions in LYMessages_en.h - TD
* first cut of integrating Jim Spath's changes to incorporate message library
  support.

* Resynch with dev tree - JES
1998-09-07 (2.8.1dev.21-intl)
* About half through language hooks in WWW/Lib... - JES
  Integrated part of Chebucto's French translations. - JES
* Included latest ABOUT-NLS from GNU project,
1998-08-27 (2.8.1dev.21-intl)
* Tested language hooks using src/LYNews.c and Italian messages file
  provided by Sabato De Rosa <sabato.derosa@usa.net>.  Made changes to
  LYMain.c, LYMainLoop.c, LYNews.c and HTNews.c. - JES
1998-08-27 (2.8.1dev.21-intl)
* add hooks to GNU gettext for international language support - JES
  (This is an experimental modification that will be patched into
  the main Lynx release after other platform testing. I've only done
  NetBSD.)

1998-11-05 (2.8.2dev.1)
* relax the cookie sanity checking for version 0 (old) cookies _only when_ the
  user has accept_all_cookies set (patch by Risto Widenius
  <widenius@ling.helsinki.fi>)
* modify get_listen_socket() to check if master_socket is set before attempting
  to use it in FD_CLR (patch by Karl-Andre Skevik <karls@kosmo.inet.no>)
* minor documentation fixes - DK
* use $(LIBS) symbol in src/chrtrans/makefile.in (reported by Alois Maier
  <m9235159@grz08u.unileoben.ac.at>)
* Fix core dump which may happen after printing-to-email. - LP
* Move read_rc() before parsing any command-line arguments (except -help)
  so the latter will override any .lynxrc settings. In particular, the problem
  was detected with -cookie_file= which was ignored after saving values
  from Options menu. - LP
* Chartrans bug: LYNXIMGMAP now shows the text in right charset.
  (The page was converted twice, fixed by adding META charset to this internal
  page. The bug was in all versions of Lynx starting from 2.7.1ac) - LP
* Oops, my typo from pre3 back to 27-09-98: windows-1252 appears twice
  in the list of character sets in options menu, was also typo in docs. - LP
* modify HTDOS.c to permit compile with K&R compiler - TD
1998-10-27 (2.8.1rel.2)
* tidy up version numbers - TD
* modify HTDOS.h to permit compile with K&R compiler - TD
1998-10-24 (2.8.1rel.1)
* reorganize lynx_help_main.html - PW
* minor change to WWW/.../tcp.h to eliminate redefinition warning by DEC C - TD
* move checking for command-line "-head" and related options before curses
  initialization so that program exits with correct terminal settings
  (report by LV, fix by BL).
* correct uninitialized index into id_append in makeuctb, which causes problems
  with def7_uni.tbl (analysis by LP)
* add TAGSOUP flag to lynx.cfg to set initial state of Tag Soup vs SortaSGML
  (request by LP) - TD
* add PERSISTENT_COOKIES flag to lynx.cfg to allow disabling the persistent
  cookies feature in a Lynx executable (request by BJP) - TD
* modify read_cfg so that it does not display included-file information when
  NO_CONFIG_INFO is defined (reported by LP) - TD
* minor/cosmetic fixes for comments and documentation - LP
* revised patch for nsl-fork, which does not rely on WNOWAIT definition - BL
* include termio.h in LYCurses.c only #ifdef TERMIO_AND_CURSES (Philippe
  De Muyter <phdm@macqel.be>)
* modify cfg_defs.sh to work when the 'set' command emits double-quotes
  (pg@sweng.stortek.com)
* update obsolete copy of HTFWriter.c to add content-encoding for HTFileSuffix
  (reported by David Helder <dhelder@umich.edu) - TD
1998-10-17 (2.8.1pre.11)
* add dependency on cfg_defs.h to src/makefile.in for LYShowInfo.o
  (pg@sweng.stortek.com)
* modify add_item_to_list() so that if the restriction flag is omitted from
  a download/upload/extern line in lynx.cfg, it is assumed true.  Also check
  for null command string in LYExtern.c (bug report by HN) - TD
* modify logic in forms-options menu so that assume_char_set now works
  correctly for any LYRawMode value by synchronizing gen_options() and
  postoptions() via rawmode memory - LP
* correct ifdef'ing in LYShowInfo.c for non-Unix platforms - LP
* modify nsl_fork logic to handle a case where child exits successfully
  right after parent's select timed out (reported by Serge Munhoven) - BL
* small updates to lynx_help files and other documentation (BJP, PW, LV).
* add #define's for later work to simplify configuring the maximum number
  of cookies (suggested by BJP) - TD
* flush output in makeuctb, as possible fix for build problems on systems that
  do not implement POSIX 'exit()' call (reported by Serge Munhoven
  <munhoven@mema.ucl.ac.be> and Jan Hlavacek <lahvak@math.ohio-state.edu>) - TD
* put GOTOBUFFER, JUMPBUFFER and QUIT_DEFAULT_YES back the way they used to be
  (majority decision) - TD
1998-10-14 (2.8.1pre.10)
* add/use HTSYS_purge and HTSYS_remove functions (based on report by Tony
  Bolton and patch by BJP dealing with removing older versions of cookie files)
  - TD
* add --disable-config-info option - TD
* change configure script --enable-forms-options to --disable-forms-options,
  add --disable-menu-options - TD
* comment-out FM's code to fold cookie headers and force cookies to be presented
  in the same order that they were received - BJP
* use full "Implementation" directory name in include path in WWW djgpp
  makefile - DK
* use HTDOS_name() to force DOS temporary-directory into consistent form - DK
* include HTVMSUtils.h and HTDOS.h from LYUtils.h, consolidate some ifdef's
  using macro HTSYS_name - TD
* another fix for HTTCP.c, for lookups with Lynx/32 - WB
* add fallback to $TMPDIR for Lynx temporary directory on Unix - TD
* remove verbose_links variable due to popular demand - TD
1998-10-10 (2.8.1pre.9)
* add verbose_links variable to lynx.cfg and userdefs.h to control whether Lynx
  should show "(LINK)" before links (request/patch by Moshe Zadka
  <moshez@math.huji.ac.il>) - TD
* change defaults in lynx.cfg and userdefs.h, add comments - PW
  (a) defaults are stated for `verbose' & `KB';
  (b) GOTOBUFFER & JUMPBUFFER defaults to TRUE;
  (c) QUIT_DEFAULT_YES defaults to FALSE
* restore suggested file name in download menu:  it is really useful for other
  download methods which should be available in menu when `save to disk' is
  disabled.  Remove local_path/ prefix (LYNX_SAVE_SPACE if any) from visible
  suggested file name string near the top instead - LP
* restore newline position when toggling comments parsing (at least we could
  return to previous screen to try comments toggling twice) - LP
* add a link from keystrokes help for edit_help.html (input line keys) - LP
* corrected to make -nostatus command-line option override HTReadProgress - TD
* updates to lynx-dev.html (Al Gilman).
* modify NSL-fork support in HTTCP.c to use waitpid call to reap child processes
  which may otherwise become orphaned.  The new variable "dns_patience"
  represents how many seconds we're willing to wait for DNS to respond (should
  later make it configurable) - BL
* modify PutTextInput and PutDefs macros in LYOptions.c and LYShowInfo.c to
  avoid pre-ANSI compilers attempting to substitute macro parameters in
  coincidental matches within quoted strings - BL
  gcc -Wtraditional reports the first, but not the second, which is "n"
  substituted into "\n" - TD
* add an error-check for fg/bg values to lynx_chg_color function in case lynx.cfg
  specifies color names not in Lynx's table - BL
* modify IsOurFile function to accommodate links-to-links, so that users whose
  home directory is reached by that type of path can save .lynxrc file
  (reported by PW) - TD
1998-10-04 (2.8.1pre.8)
* modify HTTCP.c to copy soc_in from phost in HTParseInet, making Lynx/32 do
  lookups again - WB
* modify LYCurses.c to compile mouse-code with Borland C and PDCURSES 2.3 - WB
* correct backward logic in CF_TERMIOS_AND_CURSES (reported by LE) - TD
1998-10-04 (2.8.1pre.7)
* add special-case CF_TERMIOS_AND_CURSES configure macro (fixes problem reported
  by Philippe De Muyter) - TD
* update/reorganize option_help.html - PW
* restore newline position when return from the Print menu or follow a link
  from History page (was broken for partial display mode only):  LYPop() and
  LYPop_num now reinitialize Newline_partial if it happens on getfile stage.
  Also remove changes from 1998-06-11 (case LYK_DOWNLOAD) since this is now
  protected by HText_new() which never starts.  - LP
* tweak suggested filename for download menu: now it we have URL
  terminated with "/" (e.g. a directory or possibly root) do one more try -
  remove terminating "/" - LP
* download menu: do not show "Suggested file name" when "save to disk disabled"
  (requested by HN) - LP
* more tweaks on LYshow_kb_rate - LP
* move fallback definitions for POSIX S_ISLNK, etc., to allow build with
  VAX C (reported by Tony Bolton) - TD
* add parentheses to eval-expression in CF_MAKE_INCLUDE configure test to
  accommodate bash2 (Tadayoshi Okuma <tad@pht.co.jp>)
1998-10-01 (2.8.1pre.6)
* add EMX to special cases for SetOutputMode, to force stdout to O_BINARY mode
  so that downloading binary files will not corrupt them (reported by Ilya
  Zakharevich <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>) - TD
* correct missing "\n\" in change to LYrcFile.c for pre.4 (reported by David
  Eaton) - TD
* reorder HTCheckForInterrupt() so that partial display mode will work for
  VMS (reported by LP) - TD
* fix LYK_DOWNLOAD to restrict downloading remote links for local_host_only,
  like it was done for mailto: links recently, see comments where in. - LP
* replace few statusline messages with ones from LYMessages.en.h
1998-09-30 (2.8.1pre.5)
* force compile on VMS to use stdarg.h; it was ifdef'd for __STDC__ which
  VAX C does not define, though it does support stdarg.h (reported by Tony
  Bolton).  Test-compile HTVMS_WaisUI.c on Linux to check... - TD
* update url for tcplib in INSTALLATION - DK
* fix HTDOS_name trace massage - LP
* expand "~" in include-statements in lynx.cfg (reported by LP) - TD
* remove some obsolete stuff from INSTALLATION - HN
* DOSPATH fix: user input URL like c:/path/file.ext (begins with drive letter)
  now resolved as local path and will not be passed to DNS search in any case
  (was running URL guessing process for host "c:" if file.ext not found...)
  fix LYFillLocalFileURL() - LP
* fix HTUserMsg2 trace massage - LP
* add user's guide documentation for COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and
  COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAINS - BJP
* change default Unix cookie-file name to "~/.lynx_cookies" - BJP
* customize incremental rendering:
  - add -partial_thres[=NUMBER] option to set the number of lines
  - add PARTIAL_THRES config variable in lynx.cfg to set the number of lines
  - add partial_thres variable in .lynxrc to set the number of lines.
    Selecting save to disk and hitting Accept Changes in options menu will save
    this variable to the current value.  Haven't looked into making a form
    entry for this yet.  With -partial_thres command line option, probably not
    necessary (patch by Eric <erbrun@bellatlantic.net>).
* fix some text in lynx.man and Lynx_user_guide.html.  The man change includes
  changes to "h" and "k" so they work whether or not vi keys are on - DK
* workaround for inconsistency between slang ports to DOS and other platforms
  by suppressing test of SLtt_Use_Ansi_Colors.  This fixes a problem where
  colors change in the slang DOS port when the forms_based option menu is
  accepted - DK
1998-09-28 (2.8.1pre.4)
* tentative fix for HPUX sed problems (reported by jones.peter@uqam.ca) - TD
* update lynx.man and lynx.hlp to reflect new command-line options - TD
* minor documentation fix - LP
* miscellaneous fixes for build on VMS (reported by Tony Bolton) - TD
* tweak 'const' assignment for VMS (in LYReadCFG.c and LYPrint.c) - LP
* clarify discussion of download in Lynx user's guide (Al Gilman).
* trim trailing newline from lines read from cookie file so that Lynx does
  not send embedded newlines in the cookie list - BJP
1998-09-27 (2.8.1pre.3)
* fix a place in cookie_add{accept,reject}list() where cookies would be deleted
  from memory if a persistent cookie had the same domain as an entry in
  COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS - BJP
* move Lynx's writing of persistent cookies to COOKIE_FILE from happening when
  you enter the Cookie Jar page to quit time, before cleaning up temporary
  files - BJP
* Lynx_user_guide.html: add text about lynx.cfg - LP
* forms-options: options names moved 2 columns to the right (is it good?) - LP
* fix reading .lynxrc "character_set" (trim trailing spaces in fullname) - LP
* fix ReadProgress message for LYshow_kb_rate (while <1024 bytes received
  we showed byte-transfer rate even in KB mode), extra dot removed - LP
* DOS text files: opening text mode switch now incorporated in LYNewTxtFile/
  LYAppendToTxtFile and hope for the best - LP
1998-09-25 (2.8.1pre.2)
* fixed forms submission charset: was broken by me in dev26 (HText_SubmitForm()
  in GridText.c) - LP
* documentation updates for verbose images - LP
* minor fix for trace message in TrimHightext() -LP
* add compatibility with 2.8/2.7.2 lynx.cfg and (especially) .lynxrc - old
  "character_set" parameter now acceptable - LP
* add OUTGOING_MAIL_CHARSET symbol to lynx.cfg to make mail more recognizable
  by remote recipient, it may be "US-ASCII" for 7 bit approximation as the
  safest case or any other value.  If blank, use display character set
  (default, compatibility).  Currently implemented only for "subject" in
  "print-to-email" - LP
* fix SGML.c so invalid characters are not dispalayed in hex UHHHH but just
  omitted as already done for plain/text mode - LP
* fix download' suggested file name (8bit) - LP
* correct logic error in "Change Location" command, and allow "~" there in
  addition to the existing "~/" prefix (reported by Ismael Cordeiro) - TD
* ifdef'd out "don't replace '\n' with ' ' if Chinese or Japanese" from dev.23,
  with symbol EXP_JAPANESE_SPACES, FIX_JAPANESE_SPACES based on discussion with
  HN, LP - TD
* correct missing '\' in generated sed-script for "make install-help" rule,
  which changed a couple of "/html" substrings to ".html" (reported by BL) - TD
* modify cfg_defs.sh script to handle empty token in config.cache, e.g., a line
  such as "foo=${foo=}" (reported by Philip Chong <pchong@boopsie.ml.org>) - TD
* modify so that lynx_cfg_infopage() and lynx_compile_opts() pages are not
  invoked when Lynx is running -anonymous - TD
1998-09-22 (2.8.1pre.1)
* correct logic error in parse_restrictions() which caused infinite loop,
  probably from changes in dev.8 (reported by HN) - TD
* add SHOW_KB_RATE symbol to lynx.cfg to allow user to control whether
  HTReadProgress should show KB/sec or bytes/sec - TD
* modify HTReadProgress to allow user to display KB/sec or bytes/sec - BL
* add/use new function LYstyles(), to force initialization of styles[] array
  when it is used outside HTML.c; fixes a problem with Lynx not using styles
  for files listed on the command line - TD
* correct keymap strings for F1 and DO_KEY - TD
* add keymap table entries for F1, to accommodate slang which appears to ignore
  terminal description when keymaps are defined - TD
1998-09-20 (2.8.1dev.29)
* add checks/warnings for user agent string in forms-options menu - TD
* change render_item to force a '/' before substituted path or directory strings
  if (as in OS/2 EMX) absolute filenames do not normally begin with a '/' -TD
* modify HTnameOfFile_WWW() to interpret an empty acc_method as a local file,
  allowing its use in permit_location(), making OS/2 EMX dired-mode change
  permissions work - TD
* make download and print menus a little more compact in intermediate/advanced
  user modes - TD
* correct filename shown in download menu - LP
* change behavior of configure --enable-forms-options switch.  By default, both
  old and new options menu are available via a command-line toggle
  "-forms_options" or lynx.cfg statement "FORMS_OPTIONS:TRUE/FALSE".  Configure
  --enable-forms-options now _disables_ old-style code, which is
  ifdef'ed with "#ifndef EXP_FORMS_OPTIONS" - LP
* add more pointer-checks in GridText.c so that "lynx LYNXDOWNLOAD://" does
  not crash (reported by Wilson Cheung) - TD
* add special case to handle NNTPSERVER environment variable, which had been
  lowercased as part of LYReadCFG.c cleanup (reported by Wilson Cheung
  <wcheung@netcom.com>) - TD
* modify info-page to add link to new internal page showing the noncomment
  lines from lynx.cfg - LP, TD
* use function wwwName to reduce clutter - LP
* create "lynx.cfg Information" page, comments skipped, "include" OK.
  The link is available from '='InfoPage and 'O'ptions menu.
  Since DJGPP/Win32 binary have no built-in absolute path for distributions
  lynx.cfg those ports will look for a copy of lynx.cfg in lynx_help/
  for most advanced info/comments (if you made http:// depository for lynx help
  please care of it) - LP
* tweak helpfilepath URL (for DOSPATH only) - LP
* some cleanup of cp852, cp850, cp775 - LP
1998-09-17 (2.8.1dev.28)
* minor fix to make PRCS ProjectDate print in "dd mmm yyyy" form - TD
1998-09-17 (2.8.1dev.27)
* minor fixes for recent (dev24 and dev25) chartrans changes - LP
* add LYNX_DATE definitions in userdefs.h; Info Page now shows the date of your
  lynx along with version number and a link to the latest sources.  - LP
* use ECHO_CC symbol in install-help rule to control whether the sed commands
  are echoed - TD
* corrected install-help rule to avoid getting compress-suffix repeated in
  the generated/updated files - TD
* documentation nit for COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS (Michael Warner)
* use getsockname_s rather than getsockname for djgpp (from patch by Gisle
  Vanem) - DK
* add .bz2 suffix to lynx.cfg and HTInit.c, for bzip2 utility - DK
* modify store_cookie to suppress warning message for invalid domain if Lynx is
  setup to accept all cookies - LV
* modify/expand LYLocalFileToURL() function, getting rid of most places where
  inline concatenation is used for "file://localhost/<filename>", as well
  as eliminating a number of static buffers - TD
* move fallback definitions for POSIX S_ISLNK, etc., out of NeXT ifdef's, to
  make this compile on Apollo (reported by David Eaton) - TD
* restructured pathname-tests in LYLocal.c, using common utility functions
  ok_stat, ok_lstat, ok_file_or_dir to simplify freeing pointer allocated
  by HTfullURL_toFile - TD
* modify HTLocalName, making it a macro around a more flexible function
  HTnameOfFile_WWW, to reuse logic for stripping off "file://localhost" and
  "file:" prefixes, fixing some places where a spurious '/' would be left in
  EMX local filenames (other macros: HTfullURL_toFile, HTpartURL_toFile) - TD
* modify configure script macro CF_PATH_PROGS for OS/2 EMX, so that compiled-in
  utility pathnames work - TD
* use HTDOS.c module for OS/2 EMX, since it has similar device syntax - TD
* correct logic for wrapping long lines, to not use the rightmost column of the
  screen, fixes a problem with duplicated character (reported by LP) - TD
* correct logic for dumping screen to file, so that blank lines are retained,
  not counted in the logic for pruning soft-newlines which supports wrapped
  lines - TD
* add info and user messages to traces - TD
1998-09-12 (2.8.1dev.26)
* change behavior of NSL_FORK and related I/O (patch by BL)
  - Make URL guessing (www.huh.com?  www.huh.org?  www.huh.net?) interruptible.
  - Make URL guessing from the command line interruptible.
  - Use select() instead of FIONREAD.  This makes it work on OSes where
    previously it only *looked* like it was working.
  - select() on stdin as well as the child pipe, when using [n]curses (not
    SLANG).  This allows interrupt to be processed instantly, without
    up-to-1-second delay.
  - While looping, 1 second at a time, bail out after "too many" (currently 50)
    loops:  just in case something weird happens, like select() returning some
    unexpected error that we ignore.
  - Make sure child processes are always killed and reaped.
  - Close pipe ends as soon as possible.
  - Now write the length down the pipe (using a known-to-the-program length of
    sizeof(int)) first -- this both helps workaround old CMU TCP bugs and the
    fact that select() doesn't let us get number of bytes ready, like FIONREAD
    does.
* change default for NO_ANONYMOUS_EMAIL to TRUE (patch by HN)
* use url for "W3C HTML Validation Service" rather than "A Kinder, Gentler HTML
  Validator"
* update url for HTML Quick Reference Guide (report by LE) - TE
* modify verbose images to show ISMAPs and USEMAPs (patch by LE).
* fix typos in AttrList.h, LYStrings.h (reported by LV & HN) - TD
* Chartrans recovery and cleanup:  by introducing an invariant
  "current_char_set and UCLYhndl_for_unspec always valid charsets" we solve
  possible problems with invalid/undeclared charsets.  Use
  'safeUCGetLYhndl_byMIME()' for reading charset information from
  lynx.cfg/userdefs.h/command line switches to recover possible typos by
  fallback to ISO-8859-1; If UCLYhndl_for_unrec or UCLYhndl_HTFile_for_unspec
  not set explicitely - now fallback to UCLYhndl_for_unspec (was before, but
  not clear in certain places).  Add comments to UCMap.h, add comments on
  chartrans initialization in LYMain.c.  UCAssume_localMIMEcharset and
  UCAssume_unrecMIMEcharset now removed (UCLYhandl_* do all the stuff).  - LP
* LYCharSets.c:  LYRawMode code simplified and comments added.  It was realized
  that UCAssume_MIMEcharset may differ from its handler as LYRawMode history.
  Also:  HTMLSetRawModeDefault() moved into HTMLUseCharacterSet() to reduce
  clutter, declare HTMLSetCJKCharacterSet() as PRIVATE.  - LP
* more "big5" bugs fixed (in HTMIME.c and HTFile.c); function Set_HTCJK() added
  to LYCharSets.c - LP
* LYCharUtils.c:  META charset code corrected against 2.7.2, obsolete code
  removed - LP
* partial mode now repaint the screen in one stage with a complete display
  ('display_lines' received, fix in HTPartialDisplay()).  Incremental rendering
  of the first page may be annoying on slow connection (reported by Nelson
  Henry Eric <nelsonhe@nara.kindai.ac.jp>) - LP
* temp fix for HText_trimHightext side effect from partial mode by introducing
  a flag in HText_beginInput(), so this side effect still only happens for long
  documents with forms input mixed with normal href= link.  - LP
* print menu: fixed document URL near the top (was temp file name) - LP
* forms-options menu: fixed screen size in Novice mode - LP
* limit length of strings copied via tok_values[] in LYCookies.c - TD
* clean up a few memory leaks in cookie_add_acceptlist() and
  cookie_add_rejectlist() in LYCookie.c.  These were leaking 4 bytes for each
  entry in COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS - BJP
* fix to LYLoadCookies() which was causing duplicate invalid cookies to be
  loaded - BJP
* split out install-doc rule in top-level makefile to install extra documentation
  files in $(libdir)/lynx_doc (request by HN) - TD
* improved algorithm to set 'secure_value', used in forms-options to circumvent
  spoofing (based on comments from Mike Castle) - TD
* integrate WB's mouse changes (see 1997-04-24) for page-up/down into the Unix
  flavors of mouse support (e.g., ncurses and slang) - TD
* use ncurses define_key to implement lynx-keymaps (see dev.10) - TD
* modify slang keymap code to work with slang 0.99-38 - TD
* replace several ifdef'd pathname constructions to use LYAddPathToHome() - TD
* make keymaps file consistently named on Unix and VMS - TD
* remove redundant "Lynx" from internal-page titles (suggested by LP) - TD
* remove install-log makefile target, generate cfg_defs.h file directly from
  lynx_cfg.h and config.cache, to compile-in the configuration-definitions
  rather than rely on external file lynx_site.txt - TD
1998-09-06 (2.8.1dev.25)
* corrected compiled-in path for lynx_site.txt - TD
* implement logic for exec-links in forms-options page - TD
* add configure options --enable-exec-links and --enable-exec-scripts - TD
* correct logic for show-color in forms-options page (reported by DK) - TD.
* implement logic to set $DISPLAY in forms-options page - TD
* add/use functions LYsetXDisplay() and LYgetXDisplay() to reduce clutter - TD
* retain help-link on internal pages only for those where the pages would be
  pushed onto the history stack, and only in novice mode - TD
* absorb LYSystem.h into LYUtils.h, adding LYSystem() and LYSysShell functions
  to LYUtils.c to hide djgpp clutter - TD
* limit strings passed to mailer in LYMail.c to 7-bit ASCII, converting other
  characters to '?'.  This guards against trash on the end of the mailing
  address in a mailto link (from Duncan Simpson <dps@io.stargate.co.uk>).
* add fallback definitions for <sys/stat.h> S_xxx macros to tcp.h (from report
  by Francisco A Tomei Torres <fatomei@sandburg.unm.edu> that OpenStep 4.0
  lacks definition for S_IWOTH) - TD
* modify quote_pathname() so that for DJGPP it does not put single-quotes
  around the result - DK
* correct a missing assignment to turn bold off in split_line (GridText.c) - LE
* Fixed: forms input in display_partial mode! Previously hightext was printed
  at wrong positions while loading was in process (try -debug_partial to see
  the bug).  Fix made in HText_pageDisplay:  we call HText_trimHightext() which
  was the main part of HText_endAppend() before.  Seems no more problems
  reported from incremental rendering mode!  - LP
* set PARTIAL mode ON by default, unless it disabled in lynx.cfg or by
  configure --disable-partial option - LP
* restore temporary -debug_partial switch, broken in dev.23. - LP
* made trace in HText_appendCharacter() a little more readable
  for lynx special characters - LP
* chartrans:  human-readable character set names in Options Menu now changed
  according to Netscape 4.x style - "language (MIMEname)", it looks more useful
  and reduce chaos in people's heads.  Documentation corrected
  (option_help.html/Lynx_User_guide.html).  Minor tip:  "Central and Eastern
  European" was truncated to "Eastern European" because of space limitation in
  popup menu.  (Changes in chrtrans/*.tbl, LYCharSets.c, also docs including
  userdefs.h/lynx.cfg).  Since names were changed, users on display other than
  iso-8859-1 should go to options menu and resave .lynxrc (and probably correct
  lynx.cfg - character_set now uses MIME notation in sync with other charset
  settings, although complete name string is still acceptable for this field).
  - LP
* an attempt made to tweak the code replacing lynx internal 'main' charset '0'
  (iso-8859-1 in fact) with its MIME name. - LP
* rename ifdef EXP_8BIT_TOUPPER in favor of lynx.cfg switch FORCE_8BIT_TOUPPER
  - LP
* remove a lot of "(char **)" casts from HTML.c which obscured some type
  mismatches - TD
* add/use functions LYIsHtmlSep, LYAddHtmlSep, LYTrimHtmlSep, LYIsPathSep,
  LYAddPathSep, LYTrimPathSep to reduce clutter - TD
* fix a bug, present at least since dev.17, where lynx can't download files if
  it is started from one of the root directories of a disk drive, since it is
  trying to write to "c:\\file.ext", rather than "c:\file.ext" - DK
* correct a comment in userdefs.h; commercial Japanese sites are named with
  co.jp, not com.jp (LV).
* correct some debug messages in LYCookie.c - BJP
* fix a missing </h1> in ShowInfo.c - SKY
* modified '+'->' ' conversion to allow Unix commands to have '+' beginning
  options - TD
* sorted all option items (i.e., static variables, postoptions(), gen_options())
  according to the sections they are in - SKY
* added '+'->' ' conversion for forms-options values - SKY
* centered 'save to disk' and put a dash between 'accept' and 'reset' for
  clarity - SKY
* add "-cookie_file=" commandline option to specify cookie file - BJP
* add "cookie_file=" option to .lynxrc - BJP
* add "cookie_file:" option to lynx.cfg - BJP
* change default cookie file to "Home_Dir()/cookies" (or sys$login:cookies
  for VMS, which may or may not work, DOS also needs to be checked) - BJP
* add cookies switch to options menu - LP
* Security considerations and form-based options:  items restricted in
  gen_options() should be ALSO restricted under the same conditions in
  postoptions() to prevent a limited access user to edit option's HTML code
  manually and submit a restricted items.  This may be not a good idea to have
  two functions in sync but those functions are synchronized anyway.  Please
  read comments inside the functions if change something!  - LP
* add new functions BeginInternalPage and EndInternalPage to reduce clutter in
  code that sets up internal pages (email from LP).
* change version in makefile.in to 2-8-1 (reported by DK).
* the code in GridText that adds control characters to the current line
  does not test for buffer overflow.  Normally Lynx gets away with this because
  it will wrap the current line as soon as the line exceeds the display width,
  but if you have a file with nothing but control characters with no
  displayable text in-between (a few thousand hidden links will do), then Lynx
  bombs.  Modified to silently ignore excess control characters as well as add
  a few extra bytes when allocating the line buffer to allow for a bunch of
  control characters followed by a kanji or utf-8 sequence.  (patch by Dick
  Wesseling <ftu@fi.uu.nl>)
* remove WWW/Library/Implementation/HTInit.c, which is not used, since
  src/HTInit.c has this functionality - TD
* change ID="<number>" in Lynx_users_guide.html to ID="<name>" to appease
  weblint; tested with IE&NS - TD.
* Al's convention of '#<number>' into '#<id name>' in Lynx_users_guide.html is
  included - SKY
1998-08-31 (2.8.1dev.24)
* re-correct DH's patch for COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS (reported by LV) - TD
1998-08-29 (2.8.1dev.23)
* make interim fix for gzip'd html files until we can resolve portability
  issues raised by SKY's renaming - TD
* implement LY_SOFT_NEWLINE, to mark places where wrapping is done in
  HText_appendCharacter, to allow printing to join lines back together
  (reported by LP) - TD
* correct missing assignment in change to HText_appendCharacter, fix a core
  dump - TD
* removed SKY's change that attempted to skip help-links, since it causes a core
  dump, e.g., when viewing source - TD
* use LYCloseTempFP in forms-options code and LYPrint.c where file was opened
  with LYOpenTemp, to fix a core dump - TD
* All XYZ_TITLE defines of UIPs (User Interface Page) are collected in
  LYMessages_en.h for multi language support - SKY
* Head and H1 of each UIP is standardized; reduced to 1 line.  In this line a
  context sensitive Help anchor introduced which is skipped by default; i.e.,
  'd' will directly goto 'Save to Disk' not to the help anchor - SKY
* Download and Print UIPs are divided into 'Standard' and 'Local additions'.
  Current and Suggested Filenames are printed on the page which was hidden on
  the status line or accessed only by '=' - SKY
* Information page now has links to either development or lynx home pages
  depending on LYNX_RELEASE define.  Besides compile options can also be
  accessed on this page:  $helpdir/lynx_site.txt.  A file derived from
  'config.cache'.  Its corresponding makefile macro is 'install-log' - SKY
* New Form-based options page is re-organized; logical sections are introduced
  and sorted alphabetically (except for 'User Mode' - SKY
* All links in the help files are marked, i.e., each
  'href="../_filename.html_#section"' is converted to
  'href="../@FILENAME@#section"'.  This is useful if a help filename or
  link has to be changed through out whole package.
* 'lynx_help/help_files.txt' is introduced which contains
  FILENAME=_filename.html_ definitions.  Format and details are given in the
  file - SKY
* All help files are renamed from '.html' -> '.html_' - SKY
* For context sensitive help links in UIPs 'src/LYHelp.h' is created with all
  the filenames marked like the help files.  It will be included from
  LYGlobal.h.  In 'src/makefile.in' necessary changes are done to load the
  filenames from 'lynx_help/help_files.txt' - SKY
* To be able to compress help files '--enable-gzip-help' option is added in
  configure script.  In 'makefile' 'install-help:' is updated.
  If COMPRESS_PROG and COMPRESS_EXT are *both* left empty (default) no
  compression will be carried.  For the moment compression is restricted only
  to 'gzip'.  Necessary updates are done in configure.in - SKY
* documentation fixes for nsl-fork, print screen - PW
* don't replace '\n' with ' ' if Chinese or Japanese - HN
* use title information rather than suggested filename as a subject line when
  printing a page to email - LP
* add verbose_images to old-style options menu, and the .lynxrc - LE
* add verbose_images and useragent to forms-based options menu - LP
* disable download of "mailto:" links (reported by SKY (Sinan Kaan Yerli)
  <sky@star.cpes.susx.ac.uk> ) - LP
* Change HTUserMsg to HTInfoMsg for "ALREADY_AT_BEGIN" and "ALREADY_AT_END"
  messages to make it less annoying - LP
* reduce clutter in mainloop by inserting LYpop() in postoptions() - LP
* makefile.dos: split long lines - LP
* Fix bug with TAIPEI big5 charset in src/LYCharUtils.c
  (this typo also found in lynx2.7.2: "big-5" instead of "big5"),
  patch by Shou-Chuan Lai <chuan@cs.nthu.edu.tw> - LP
* Add -debug_partial command line switch so we got MessageSecs dely
  between incremental rendering stages if partial display mode is ON.
  (MessageSecs available from lynx.cfg and set to 2 sec by default).
  The problem in incremental rendering of forms input was reported by SKY
  (Sinan Kaan Yerli) <sky@star.cpes.susx.ac.uk> ), still not fixed
  but now we may enter form-based options menu in -debug_partial mode
  and rerender the page with Cntrl-R to see what is happening in fact. - LP
* Serious bug fixed for DISP_PARTIAL: two asynchronous processes synchronized.
  HTDisplayPartial() synchronized by flag against HText_new() which create
  the new HTMainText object. Otherwise HTDisplayPartial() sometimes was
  matching old HTMainText (with its own line counter) and repaint previous doc,
  not a new one. TRACE log now got a message from HText_pageDisplay - LP
* fixed last chartrans changes, lines such as
      #0x99    #NOTDEFINED
  should not be commented with leading comment symbol because they are ignored
  by makeuctbl in fact - LP
* modify DH's patch for COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS to only modify the nonstandard case,
  thereby making that more restrictive, and restoring standard behavior
  (reported by HN) - TD
1998-08-21 (2.8.1dev.22)
* correct test for -std1 compiler option on Digital Unix (reported by Michael
  Warner) - TD
* modify treatment of COLLAPSE_BR_TAGS, so that if it is set TRUE, two or more
  concurrent BRs will be collapsed into a single blank line.  Note that the
  valid way to insert extra blank lines in HTML is via a PRE block with only
  newlines in the block (David Henderson <davidh@psiphi.org>)
* clarification in userdefs.h - HN
* MS Windows codepages updated for EURO SIGN (0x20AC), from ftp.unicode.org - LP
* minor fix for DISP_PARTIAL, disable scrolling when HTTP request already sent
  but the new document not displayed on the screen yet - LP
* ifdef DOS/WINDOWS to open lynx.trace in text mode - LP
* rearrange text in lynx.cfg concerning character_set - LP
* correct miscellaneous typos - LP
* Fixed:  Verbose images now work with [IMAGE]-Submit.  Also, fixed the core
  dump when clickable_images is on.  The problem was an oversight in
  MakeNewTitle() - LE
* reviewed the INSTALLATION file as it relates to DOS and updated it for the
  newly released version of PDCurses 2.3.  Added the HAVE_GETBKGD define to
  makefile.dos, fixes some of the unusual background color handling that was
  present in the PDCurses DOS port - DK
* correct ifdef:  LYOptions.c fails to build with -DEXP_FORMS_OPTIONS but
  _without_ -DDIRED_SUPPORT (e.g.  djgpp) - LP
* redesigned cookie_add_{accept,reject}list in LYCookie.c -- they work now - BJP
* added COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS in .lynxrc handling to LYrcFile.c - BJP
* slight spacing fix in lynx.cfg - BJP
* added blurb in lynx.cfg about COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS - BJP
* -accept_all_cookies on the commandline works as a toggle now (against
  lynx.cfg value -- NOT against .lynxrc value) - BJP
* change HTAlert for bad partial reference to an HTUserMsg to make it less
  annoying (request by Philip Webb, Jason McBrayer)
1998-08-15 (2.8.1dev.21)
* correct pathname for help file in forms-options screen - TD
* reduce clutter in LYOptions.c with SELECTED, DISABLED, NOTEMPTY macros,
  PutOptValues, GetOptValues functions - TD
* modified LYOptions to include MBM support from form-based options,
  by making a link href="LYNXOPTIONS://MBM_MENU" like it was in LYPrint.c and
  calling edit_bookmarks() from postoptions() - LP
* add/use HTUserMsg to encapsulate most of the important messages - TD
* add/use HTInfoMsg to encapsulate most of the informational messages - TD
* make most of the alert messages use HTAlert, for consistency - TD
* exclude forms-options pages from Visited Links page - LP
* The current keymapping for the DOS Slang ports maps the keys directly to lynx
  actions via keymap.c.  There are several places in the code that test for
  arrow keys, page up or down, home and end for special handling that depend on
  the lynx definition of the keys.  Hence, the keys in the DOS Slang ports were
  failing the tests and not working as expected.  The following patch now maps
  these special keys.  They can no longer be mapped individually via the KEYMAP
  mechanism in lynx.cfg.  Arrows should now work in GOTO fields.  Tested the
  patch against the binaries maade by makefile.dos, makefile.dsl, and
  makefile.wsl - DK
* The wsl port seems to be working well with DISP_PARTIAL, make this the
  default - DK
* correct spelling in lynx.cfg - DK
* modify HText_appendCharacter to wrap long lines when displaying HTML document
  source - TD
* add configure option --enable-cgi-links - TD
* clarify discussion of no_proxy in lynx.cfg (Al Gilman).
* Multilingual bookmarks:  now we store characters >127 in bookmark titles with
  a more consistent and independent way, by keeping in unicode as &#UUUU
  (NCR=numeric character reference).  The idea belongs to Klaus Weide & Andrey
  Chernov (long ago).  It may be useful if we need switching display charset
  frequently.  This is the case when you use lynx on different platforms, e.g.
  on UNIX and from remote PC, but want to keep common bookmarks file valid.
  Compatibility:  NCR as part of I18N and HTML4.0 specifications supported
  starting with Lynx 2.7.2, Netscape 4.0 and MSIE 4.0.  New option to lynx.cfg
  added:  NCR_IN_BOOKMARKS which is FALSE by default.  - LP
* Tweak "print options menu" to exclude choises which are not available under
  the certain conditions (print to the screen and lpansi on DOS/WINDOWS, print
  to e-mail for local_host_only).  - LP
* Forms options menu:  add a link on option_help.html; synchronize
  option_help.html against Lynx_User_guide.html and lynx.cfg.  Rename label
  "raw 8-bit or CJK Mode" with "CJK Mode" for CJK people and "raw 8-bit" for
  others.  Cleanup postoptions() by introducing flags. - LP
* Force HTuncache_current_document if gen_options() invoked. This is a
  dirty fix until we uncache previous document only when necessary.  - LP
* Add time/date in addition to X-URL and BASE (PrependBaseToSource), (request
  by Hans-Joachim Gurt <gurt@nacamar.net>) - LP
* Turn partial_display off if we are not interactive (reported by Ari Moisio
  <armoi@sci.fi>) - LP
* more fixes/refinements for auto-configuring socks5 on AIX (report by Brian
  Hauber) - TD
1998-08-06 (2.8.1dev.20)
* rename eat_all_cookies to accept_all_cookies everywhere - BJP
* added ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES lines to the dist lynx.cfg with the appropriate
  description - BJP
* added COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAINS to lynx.cfg.  These are
  comma delimited lists of the domains to handle - BJP
* added cookie_add_acceptlist and cookie_add_rejectlist to LYCookie.c, which
  are passed the list of domains from lynx.cfg and add them to the global
  cookie list.  These may be subject to change, as I might not be handling the
  LYstrsep() right -- it works with dev19's LYstrsep(), but hasn't been tested
  with Bela's...  - BJP
* added a big ugly ifdef'd out section to LYrcFile.c with what I have so far on
  the .lynxrc handling of COOKIE_{ACCEPT,REJECT}_DOMAINS.  Don't use it.  Makes
  nasty segfaults - BJP (Brian J Pardy)
* fix a bug where the DJGPP_KEYHANDLER version doesn't allow movement by arrow
  keys within a text area.  Undo previous patch to LYGetFile.c, with LYgetch
  now changed where it is defined in LYStrings.c, rather than at each place
  where it is used.  The patch in LYStrings.c regarding Windows should fix the
  problem with keymapping that occurred when we got rid of RAWDOSKEYHACK - DK
* turn on DISP_PARTIAL in makefile.dos - DK
* correct typo in LYOptions.c - BL
* corrected logic of LYstrsep - BL
* Few minor typos and forgotten notes in man/hlp/cfg files; also quote Bela's
  note on lynx.cfg INCLUDE facility - LP
* correct typos in makefile.wsl, makefile.dsl - LP
* correct typos, fix character set problems in recent changes of LYOptions.c
  - LP
* move include for socks.h past tcp.h, to allow for redefinition of some
  symbols on AIX (report by Brian Hauber) - TD
* adjust headers so that each can be compiled separately, eliminating order
  dependencies - TD
* include tcp.h always from within HTUtils.h, to enforce ordering of headers
  needed for socks5 definitions - TD
* use S_ISREG, S_ISDIR macros to reduce clutter - TD
* make test for OpenHiddenFile to overwrite user's file more stringent by
  ensuring that the given pathname is not a link from a world-writable
  directory (reported by BL, with suggested patch) - TD
* add/use LYPathLeaf() function to reduce clutter of pathname-leaf parsing - TD
* eliminate redundant definition of 'FREE() - TD
* ifdef'd LYOptions.c to reduce unneeded code wrt --enable-forms-options - TD
* check in OpenHiddenFile to ensure that we overwrite only regular files,
  since we also force the file's permissions to 0600 - TD
1998-07-31 (2.8.1dev.19)
* modify OpenHiddenFile so that it can overwrite files owned by the real
  user if the O_EXCL open fails because the file already exists - TD
* add experimental forms-based options screen (patch by Mike Castle), ifdef'd
  with EXP_FORMS_OPTIONS and configured with --enable-forms-options.
* add option -eat_all_cookies and corresponding config variable
  EAT_ALL_COOKIES (Brian J Pardy <posterkid@psnw.com>).
* correct spurious 'Content' string versus newline after X-URL in LYMail.c
  (Bela Lubkin and LV).
* updated versions of config.guess and config.sub based on automake 1.3 - TD
* updated experimental persistent-cookie support based on RP's patch:  Replaced
  the call to strsep with a home-rolled one for those people who don't have it.
  (Reported by Bela Lubkin, Mon, 27 Jul 1998 16:51:14 -0700 on the mailing
  list.) Bela's modification to make some character arrays static is also
  included.
* nits/spelling in LYPrint.c, LYUtils.c (reported by Mike Castle).
* changed LYGetFile.c to build lynx2.8.1dev.18 with SLANG and the
  DJGPP_KEYHANDLER for DOS - DK

  URL's - TD
* add RP's experimental persistent-cookie support, and configure option
  --enable-persistent-cookies, ifdef'd with EXP_PERSISTENT_COOKIES - TD
* removed references to DOSRAWKEYHACK, which is no longer used.  Modified the
  dos makefile for libwww and makefile.dsl to default to using display_partial.
  Modified INSTALLATION to reflect the successful use of slang with the dos
  port and the now confusing alternatives when compiling the dos port, along
  with some other updates - DK
* modify lynx_enable_mouse() for pdcurses configuration so that mouse support
  is disabled unless -use_mouse is specified.  This is ifdef'd with
  __BORLANDC__ for the time being (WB).
* resync build-slang.com, against build.com - TD
* add $(MMSQUALIFIERS) to top-level descrip.mms, e.g., to use options such as
  /FROM, /IGNORE, /NOACTION, etc., and $(INCLUDES) definitions to lower-level
  descrip.mms files.  Improve error-recovery in build.com (patches by Liam
  Davis <ld@stian.demon.co.uk>)
* use memset to clear soc_in fields before doing a connect, needed for BSD/OS
  (patch by Jeffrey C Honig <jch@bsdi.com>).
* remove spurious sprintf params when using FIXED_RECORD_COMMAND_MASK which has
  only one parameter, change VMSsignal from void* to void (report by Mike Xun
  Ma <mike@mira.concordia.ca> ) - TD
* use open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL) to open new hidden files - TD
* eliminate_*putenv_cmd variables used by LYReadCFG.c as placeholders for
  putenv calls - TD
* disable include of <sys/filio.h> for VMS, from report by Chris Doran) - TD
* fixes for VMS: mismatched curly brace, etc., from CTRACE and buffer-overflow
  changes (reported by chris.doran@gblis.mail.abb.com) - TD
* correct a loop in HTML_start_element that strips 7 leading characters from
  an href, fixes a core-dump in traversing ".." to "/" - TD
* use new macro SetOutputMode to reduce some clutter - TD
* modify interface of LYCachedTemp so fileCache member is reset to null, fixes
  bug in my recent cleanup of temp-files, which caused a core-dump - TD
* add kb/sec rate to HTReadProgress message - TD
* modify computation in HTReadProgress to interpolate rate - LP
* One more fix for DISP_PARTIAL: to avoid blinking while reloading document
  with Newline_partial > 1 (say, we press '*' and noproxy) we repaint the page
  only when Newline_partial <= HText_getNumOfLines(). - LP
* add "-verbose" command-line switch. - LP
* DOS fix: open stdout in TEXT mode for -help and startup error message. - LP
* correct use of $mapname variable in CF_ALT_CHAR_SET (Tomas Vanhala)
1998-06-25 (2.8.1dev.17)
* add configure option --with-socks5 (request by Brian Hauber
  <bhauber@frenzy.com>) - TD
* define symbols HAVE_CURSESX_H, HAVE_JCURSES_H (report by Georg Schwarz
  <schwarz@physik.tu-berlin.de>) - TD
* modify logic that reports progress of download to update screen no more than
  once per second, fix an overrun problem (reported by Jacob Poon
  <a324poon@cdf.toronto.edu>) - TD
1998-06-11 (2.8.1dev.16)
* modify configure script to check for special compiler options which are
  assumed for particular platforms (suggested by BL) - TD
* modify display_page in GridText.c so that TRACE does not cause a repaint,
  since that causes colors to be incorrectly rendered when tracing - TD
* fix a few of the signed/unsigned mismatch warnings in GridText.c - TD
* correct pathname in LYOpenScratch call for bookmarks (reported by DK) - TD
* DISP_PARTIAL:  fix initialization of newdoc.line (case LYK_DOWNLOAD,
  mainloop) to correct display while 'd'ownloading files (it was initialized
  _after_ the download completed and was good enough without display_partial
  mode).  - LP
* correct some ifdef's for DISP_PARTIAL - LP
1998-06-04 (2.8.1dev.14)
* minor formatting fixes and documentation for upload screen - LP
* remove config.cache at beginning of configure script - TD
* eliminate cast for GetChar in LYStrings.c (from bug report by Michael Warner,
  analysis by BL) - TD
* shorten logs from WWW/* by disabling echo of compiler options as in src/* - TD
* add configure test for types pid_t and uid_t - TD
* add configure test for array type used in getgroups call, to distinguish
  between BSD and POSIX variations which use different sizes - TD

* fix compiler warnings dealing with unreached statements - TD
* change 'keymap[] array to unsigned char, move logic that relies on its size
  into LYKeymap.c - TD
* make LYOpenScratch() work properly for 8.3 names (reported by DK) - TD
* DISP_PARTIAL:  introduce separate variables Newline_partial and
  NumOfLines_partial, initialize them in mainloop and synchronize with Newline
  later when the reload completes (case NORMAL).  To reduce the CPU usage while
  downloading, call HText_pageDisplay only if NumOfLines_partial is in the
  current display page or any Scroll key pressed by the user.  We disable
  partial_display if requested URL have #fragment, otherwise user will see the
  top page first (yes, s/he will be moved to #fragment when the download
  completed, but only if no scroll keys were pressed before!).  Processing of
  "END" key changed from MAXINT to real number of lines in the document
  (important for display_partial mode) - LP.
* correct problem that caused DGJPP version built with slang 1.2.2 to lose its
  socket whenever the rendering of a http URL is interrupted with "z".  This is
  in HTCheckForInterrupt in LYUtils.c (reported by John Lewis) - DK
* add files pdcurses.key, slang.key, djgpp.key to document the keybindings
  used for DJGPP version - DK
* allow mapping of ALT and Function keys with the DOS port for both the
  PDCurses version and the SLANG version with the DJGPP keyhandler.  The
  extended keys to be mapped have to be specified numerically according to the
  definitions in curses.h (for PDCurses) or in keys.h (for SLANG with DJGPP
  keyhandler).  DJGPP maps keys up to 0x293, while PDCurses maps keys up to
  0x1c0 - DK
* don't try to use -std1 option for gcc on Digital Unix (reported by Michael
  Warner <warner@wsu.edu>) - TD
1998-05-23 (2.8.1dev.13)
* use new function LYLocalFileToUrl to cleanup some pathname references - TD
* eliminate 'tempname()' function, using LYNewTxtFile, etc., with new functions
  LYOpenTemp, LYCloseTemp, etc., so that temporary files are opened with
  appropriate permissions - TD
* correct use of cache variable in CF_ALT_CHAR_SET (reported by BL) - TD
* spell out the logic in HTPlain.c against 2.7.2:  there was a certain problem
  with chartrans in text/plain mode (LYRawMode was wrongly interferring,
  problem reported by Jacob Poon & FM).  - LP
* modify logic for zero-width spaces in conv_uni_to_pc to exclude 0x200a - LP
* supply missing "break", which was forcing raw utf-8 output in URLs (NOT hex
  escaped) - LP
1998-05-14 (2.8.1dev.12)
* remove unneeded definition used in testing dev.11 from config.hin) - TD
1998-05-14 (2.8.1dev.11)
* fixes for function-keys with slang configuration on DOS (patch by DK).
* correct missing '&' in command-line options entry for syslog (reported by
  HN) - TD
* correct initial value for NoColorvideo with PDCurses, from my error in
  1998-05-10 integration (reported by DK) - TD
1998-05-10 (2.8.1dev.10)
* eliminate assignment to stderr for trace-file by making tfp a function. - TD
* added John Davis' keymaps/keysym patch (it really should be integrated with
  the normal lynx.cfg file).
* tweak chartrans, "Convert the octet to Unicode":  incoming symbols >127 but <
  LYlowest_eightbit[IN-charset] now ignored, previously displayed as UFFFD.
  (SGML.c, HTPlain.c, LYCharUtils.c) - LP
* removed conflicting/unused declaration of 'bzero()' from tcp.h (from report
  by Ashraf Zorkani <zorkani@aucegypt.edu>) - TD
* modify the set/unset/toggle options to allow "on" and "off" values also - TD
* apply the "partial display" patch, modified from:
      http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0398/msg00993.html
  The behavior is controlled by a compile-time option (DISP_PARTIAL), by a
  command-line argument (-partial), and by a lynx.cfg option (PARTIAL).  - BL
* extend command-line option processing of set/unset/toggle options
      -toggle-     (set that toggle to FALSE)
      -toggle+     (set that toggle to TRUE)
  e.g.,
      lynx -show_cursor+ -case-
  or with explicit 1/0 values, e.g.,
      -toggle=0     (set that toggle to FALSE)
      -toggle=1     (set that toggle to TRUE)
  NOTE:  this allows you to change a few flags that would previously have been
  controlled by lynx.cfg, and are security-related, such as -locexec or
  -telnet.  I believe there is no issue, because if the user can control the
  command line to Lynx, he could have run `lynx -cfg my_cfg_file` and
  circumvented those settings anyway.  - BL
* fix for buffer-overrun in LYMail.c when processing a mailto:very-long-address
  URL - BL
* correct, for OS/2 EMX, a place in LYConvertToURL() which must not use
  HTDOS_wwwName() (patch by Jason F. McBrayer <jmcbray@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu>)
* similar changes to LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYStrings.c, add src/makefile.wsl, for building
  DOS version with slang - Bill Schiavo
* modify LYCurses.c, LYMain.c, LYStrings.c, add src/makefile.dsl, for building
  DOS version with slang - DK
* fix to improve reloading if user changed assume_charset in options menu
  using ^A, which sometimes did not work - LP
* add several chartrans-related files to test/ directory:  spaces.html,
  c1.html, raw8bit.html - LP
* fixes to compile on SunOS with K&R compiler. - TD
1998-05-03 (2.8.1dev.9)
* correct missing counter increment in tempname(), from cleanup. - TD
1998-05-02 (2.8.1dev.8)
* Fix for CGI-related URLs processing (syntax:  ?x=1&yz=2).  To avoid interfere
  with SGML we restrict '=' as terminator for a named entity, this only applied
  for HREF= attribute translation (LYCharUtils.c).  (reported by Alex Matulich
  alex@unicorn.us.com & FM).  - LP
* restore information in the INSTALLATION file for the DOS port on patching
  tcplib.  Also, clarifies the location of nullpkt.  It also clarifies
  that the PDCurses beta has incorporated some of the patches we made for
  the lynx DOS port. - DK
* modify logic that updates bookmark file after removing a link to use copy
  rather than rename, to solve file-ownership problems (patch by Paul
  Gilmartin, though I kept the permissions check). - TD
* reduce a little of the clutter in tempname() with fmt_tempname, and
  bad_tempname functions.  Though this doesn't address the security problems it
  does fix the problem with signed getpid values.  - TD
* simplify LYUtils.c with compare_type() function - TD
* add/use string functions LYLowerCase, LYUpperCase, LYRemoveBlanks (replaces
  collapse_spaces), LYTrimLeading, LYTrimTrailing (incidentally fixes core-dump
  in LYCookie.c) - TD
* rewrite read_cfg function to make it more table-driven (reworked from a
  patch by John Davis) - TD
* rewrite parse_arg function to make it more table-driven (reworked from a
  patch by John Davis) - TD
* omit -Olimit compiler option on Digital UNIX 4.0 (patch by Tomas Vanhala).
* modify configure test for acs_map[] array to work on Digital UNIX 4.0
  (reported by Jim Spath and Tomas Vanhala <vanhala@ling.helsinki.fi>).  - TD
1998-04-23 (2.8.1dev.7)
* fix core-dump when pressing '.' on a page with no links (patch by
  Jan Hlav\'{a}\v{c}ek <lahvak@math.ohio-state.edu>).
* initial changes to use macros CTRACE and tfp to replace explicit use of
  stderr for the trace log.  Remaining work is required for some complex
  expressions, switching file pointers and for perror-substitute. - TD
* ifdef's for OS/2 EMX, mostly pathname tweaks (patch by Jason F. McBrayer
  <jmcbray@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu>).
1998-04-18 (2.8.1dev.6)
* correct misplaced ifdef in LYMail.c, which caused Cc to not work (patch
  by LE).
* convert \x escapes to octal form (reported by Claude Soma). - TD
* modify configure script to check for cursesX before curses library, for
  ultrix 4.3 (reported by Claude Soma <soma_c@decus.fr>). - TD
* incorporate lpansi into LYPrint.c (patch by HN).
* modify top-level makefile to use INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_DATA
  consistently, rather than installbin and installdoc (reported by
  <karl@deas.harvard.edu>).  - TD
* modify treatment of -auth and -pauth options to allow setting a blank
  password, e.g., -pauth=user:  specifies a blank password, and -pauth=user
  leaves the password unspecified (patch by Frederick P Herrmann
  <fph@tiac.net>).
* Change documentation to indicate "Lynx.trace" file rather than "lynx.trace".
* Change default for USE_TRACE_LOG in userdefs.h to TRUE, to make behavior
  consistent with 2.7.2 - TD
* Rename no_color_video symbol in LYCurses.c to NoColorVideo, to avoid conflict
  with term.h, which is included by curses.h on some systems (reported by Paul
  Gilmartin). - TD
* modify include-path in djgpp makefile to avoid conflicting tcp.h - DK
* Add -tagsoup option, for initializing parser directly to TagSoup. - TD
* Modify HTML.c, ifdef'ing some of the logic involved in unstacking tags.  It
  appears to be not completely necessary:  makes Lynx a little faster, at the
  cost of making the tagsoup parser do the wrong thing.  Some entries in the
  tagsoup DTD table versus the sortasgml table have SGML_EMPTY versus
  SGML_MIXED.  This information is used to control unstacking (in the
  color-style configuration as well).  There is still a problem evidenced
  when toggling between the two parsers in the Lynx main help page, but that
  appears to be missing logic in 2.8's version of the tagsoup parser.  - TD
* Modify HTTCP.c to check the length returned from gethostbyname(), which
  returns 0 on error on a SunOS 4 system (reported by Paul Gilmartin). - TD
1998-03-29 (2.8.1dev.5)
* Fixed my typo for FNAMES_8_3 define. WB
* Added SYSTEM_MAIL and SYSTEM_MAIL_FLAGS defines for DOSPATH target. WB
* Better kluge to set terminal type for DOSPATH. WB
* Restored DOSPATH kludge to get to root of directory. WB
* Added a bit of missing _WINDOWS_NSL ifdef'ing. WB
* Minor DOS dirent mod to work with Tom's rearrangements. WB
* Changed #if XYZ to #ifdef XYZ in tcp.h for dumb (?) compilers. WB
1998-03-25 (2.8.1dev.4)
* restore original string in LYUtils.c when user enters a badly formed or
  nonexistent URL when prompted for Goto/history list (patch by Randall
  <hezekiah@may98.rahul.net>).  Otherwise Lynx would always attempt to load a
  local file if the original string omits scheme:// prefix but guessing fails.
* tweak formatting of .message in HTFTP.c so it has leading/trailing blank
  lines (patch by Ismael Cordeiro <ismael@CAM.ORG>)
* retested 'make depend' rule (for LV (Larry Virden)) - TD
* eliminate (except for absolute pathnames, as in VMS) quoted includes - TD
* remove WWW/Library/Implementation/HTAlert.[ch], since they conflict with
  src/HTAlert.[ch], and are not used - TD
* replace the [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE] comments (for images without ALT)
  with filenames of these images.  This feature can be enabled or disabled by
  setting VERBOSE_IMAGES in lynx.cfg and/or userdefs.h (patches by
  helen@voland.cc.huji.ac.il and wschiavo@concentric.net>)
* consistently use ${cf_cv_ncurses_header-curses.h} rather than
  $cf_cv_ncurses_header in configure script, as noted by JS - TD
* tweak include of HTML.h in HTFile.h to fix compile problem on VMS (we really
  should not use quote-style includes) - TD
* fixes to LYStyle.c to make color-style code work on Digital Unix 4.0 - TD
1998-03-20 (2.8.1dev.3)
* Added death for Win/DOS clients that don't have a TMP space defined. - WB
* Added _WINDOWS_NSL to provide interruptable lookups in Win32 per a
  patch from afn06760@afn.org. (modified hopefully for borland AND cygwin and
  hard defined in tcp.h).  I had to recompile everything in multithread
  mode for borland, including my zlib library. - WB
* Added _WINDOWS as a target for FNAMES_8_3 in userdefs.h to allow for 16
  bit helper apps that can't handle LFN's. (report by afn06760@afn.org) - WB
1998-03-18 (2.8.1dev.1)
* correct an ifdef that caused inconsistent pathname separators on Windows
  (reported by afn, patch by DK).
* correct a missing AC_MSG_RESULT in configure.in (also MM) - TD
* guard against illegal (e.g., zero) value for DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE, when it is
  read from lynx.cfg (reported by Martin Mokrejs
  <mmokrejs@prfdec.natur.cuni.cz>) - TD
* implement simple 'include' facility for lynx.cfg - BL
* change TagClass and TagFlags to #define's to accommodate older compilers
  which do not accept initialization of enums from data that do not correspond
  to the declared values, e.g., CLIX (which complains) and Apollo (which fails
  to compile, reported by Dave Eaton).  - TD
* remove some obsolete definitions from userdefs.h, tcp.h and HTUtils.h - TD
* remove obsolete files from WWW/Library - TD
1998-03-12
* UPPER8: a separate function HTMLSetDisplayCharsetMatchLocale() introduced
  (LYCharSets.c). Locale mismatch assumed for DOS/WINDOWS display charsets. - LP
