* guard against illegal (e.g., zero) value for DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE, when it is
  read from lynx.cfg (reported by Martin Mokrejs
  <mmokrejs@prfdec.natur.cuni.cz>) - TD
* implement simple 'include' facility for lynx.cfg - BL
* change TagClass and TagFlags to #define's to accommodate older compilers
  which do not accept initialization of enums from data that do not correspond
  to the declared values, e.g., CLIX (which complains) and Apollo (which fails
  to compile, reported by Dave Eaton).  - TD
* remove some obsolete definitions from userdefs.h, tcp.h and HTUtils.h - TD
* remove obsolete files from WWW/Library - TD
