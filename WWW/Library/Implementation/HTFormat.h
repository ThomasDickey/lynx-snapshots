   different data representations.  (In MIME parlance, a representation is known as a
   content-type. In WWW  the term "format" is often used as it is shorter).
   
   This module is implemented by HTFormat.c . This hypertext document is used to generate
   the HTFormat.h include file.  Part of the WWW library .
