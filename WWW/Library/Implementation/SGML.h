/*                                                SGML parse and stream definition for libwww
                               SGML AND STRUCTURED STREAMS
                                             
   The SGML parser is a state machine. It is called for every character
   
   of the input stream. The DTD data structure contains pointers
   
   to functions which are called to implement the actual effect of the
   
   text read. When these functions are called, the attribute structures pointed to by the
   DTD are valid, and the function is passed a pointer to the curent tag structure, and an
   "element stack" which represents the state of nesting within SGML elements.
   
   The following aspects are from Dan Connolly's suggestions:  Binary search, Strcutured
   object scheme basically, SGML content enum type.

Structured Object definition

   A structured object is something which can reasonably be represented in SGML.  I'll
   rephrase that.  A structured object is am ordered tree-structured arrangement of data
   which is representable as text.The SGML parer outputs to a Structured object. A
   Structured object can output its contents to another Structured Object. It's a kind of
   typed stream. The architecure is largely Dan Conolly's. Elements and entities are
   passed to the sob by number, implying a knowledge of the DTD. Knowledge of the SGML
   syntax is not here, though.
   
   Superclass: HTStream
   
   The creation methods will vary on the type of Structured Object.Maybe the callerData is
   enough info to pass along.
