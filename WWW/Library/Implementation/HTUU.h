/*                              ENCODING TO PRINTABLE CHARACTERS
                                             
   File module provides functions HTUU_encode() and HTUU_decode() which convert a buffer
   of bytes to/from RFC 1113 printable encoding format. This technique is similar to the
   familiar Unix uuencode format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one ASCII character (or
   more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII characters).  However, RFC 1113 does not use the
   same mapping to printable characters as uuencode.
