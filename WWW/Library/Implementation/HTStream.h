   A Stream object is something which accepts a stream of text.
   
   The creation methods will vary on the type of Stream Object.   All creation methods
   return a pointer to the stream type below.
   
   As you can see, but the methods used to write to the stream and close it are pointed to
   be the object itself.

   These are the common methods of all streams.  They should be self-explanatory, except

   The put_block method was write, but this upset systems whiuch had macros for write().
