User Authentication

   HTAA_checkPassword(username,password,passwdfile)opens the password file, and checks if
   the username-password pair is correct. Return value is YES, if and only if they are
   correct. Otherwise, and also if the open fails, returns NO.
   
   If the given password file name is NULL or an empty string, the default password file
   name is used (macro PASSWD_FILE).
