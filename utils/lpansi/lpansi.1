.SH SYNOPSIS
lpansi [options] [file-list]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH The Problem
UNIX supplies a printing program called lp <filename> which 
allows the user to print a text (or any really) file to a 
printer.  Unfortunately, that printer is attached to the UNIX 
server which is not where the user usually is.  In my case, it is 
about 230 miles away.  I needed a similar program that would 
allow me to print to my home printer.  

.SH The solution: 
The VT100 standard defines a printer on and off escape 
sequence.  [FYI: esc[5i is printer on, esc[4i is printer off.]
Lpansi is a VERY simple program that issues a printer on 
sequence, opens the files sent as an argument, reads it character
by character, echos it to stdout (now your local printer) and
ends by sending a form feed and printer off command.

.SH Usage:  
I had several purposes in mind when I wrote this.  The first was to
find a way to replace lp in a gopher client I had with something that
would print at home.  I also wanted to be able to print text 
files to my home printer directly from the UNIX prompt.  A 
natural extension of this is to add it to LYNX, and other printing
clients as your printer command.

.SH Syntax:
This program accepts miltiple filenames as an argument.
If no filename is present, lpansi will use standard input.
.SH Thanks: 
Thanks go to Michael Seibel on the PINE development team for 
helping me find the correct ANSI codes to turn off the printer.  
I found out later that PINE distributes a similar program called 
ansiprt which is supposed to do the same thing.  Here, the source
code is provided so you may incorporate the concept directly in your
program.

.SH Options:
.nfill
    -f  Form feed off, no form feed at end of each file
    -v  Verbose, prints helpful information for debugging purposes.
.fill
.SH Disclaimer:  
[Everyone has one so...] I make no promises whatsoever about 
how this will work for you.  If you have VT100 and/or ANSI, it
should work just fine.  If it doesn't, quit using it.  :)  This
program is free to use and modify, but try to keep my name with
it.  I don't do that much cool stuff, so I need all the credit
I can get.  Thanks.

.SH EXAMPLES
lpansi .profile

Will print the file named .profile to a printer attached to your terminal.
NCSA Telnet, WRC Reflections for PC, and Kermit are known to work.

In pine, use lpansi by typing "m" for "Main Menu", then selecting "s" for
setup.  Next, enter "p" for "Printer", and select "1. Printer attached to 
IBM PC or compatible, Macintosh".  From then on, when you choose print
in pine, it will be sent to your terminal program and attached printer.
