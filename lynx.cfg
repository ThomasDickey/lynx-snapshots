# lynx.cfg file.
# The default placement for this file is /usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg (Unix)
#                                     or Lynx_Dir:lynx.cfg (VMS)

# Definition pairs are of the form  VARIABLE:DEFINITION
# NO spaces are allowed between the pair items.
#
#  If you do not have write access to /usr/local/bin you may change
#  the default location of this file in the userdefs.h file and recompile,
#  or specify its location on the command line with the "-cfg"
#  command line option.
#
# Items may be commented out by putting a '#' as the FIRST char of the line
#
# All definitions must be flush left and have NO spaces.!!!

# Starting with Lynx 2.8.1, the lynx.cfg file has a crude "include"
# facility.  This means that you can take advantage of the global lynx.cfg
# while also supplying your own tweaks.
#
# You can use a command-line argument (-cfg /where/is/lynx.cfg) or an
# environment variable (LYNX_CFG=/where/is/lynx.cfg).
# For instance, put in your .profile or .login:
#
#   LYNX_CFG=~/lynx.cfg; export LYNX_CFG   # in .profile for sh/ksh/bash/etc.
#   setenv LYNX_CFG ~/lynx.cfg             # in .login for [t]csh
#
# Then in ~/lynx.cfg:
#
#   INCLUDE:/usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg
#           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ or whatever is appropriate on your system
# and now your own tweaks.
#
# Starting with Lynx 2.8.2, the INCLUDE facility is yet more powerful.  You can
# suppress all but specific settings that will be read from included files. 
# This allows sysadmins to provide users the ability to customize lynx with
# options that normally do not affect security, such as COLOR, VIEWER, KEYMAP.
#
# The syntax is
#
#   INCLUDE:filename for <space-separated-list-of-allowed-settings>
#
# sample:
#INCLUDE:~/lynx.cfg for COLOR VIEWER KEYMAP
# only one space character should surround the word 'for'.  On Unix systems ':'
# is also accepted as separator.  In that case, the example can be written as
#INCLUDE:~/lynx.cfg:COLOR VIEWER KEYMAP
# In the example, only the settings COLOR, VIEWER and KEYMAP are accepted by
# lynx.  Other settings are ignored.  Note:  INCLUDE is also treated as a
# setting, so to allow an included file to include other files, put INCLUDE in
# the list of allowed settings.
#
# If you allow an included file to include other files, and if a list of
# allowed settings is specified for that file with the INCLUDE command, nested
# files are only allowed to include the list of settings that is the set AND of
# settings allowed for the included file and settings allowed by nested INCLUDE
# commands.  In short, there is no security hole introduced by including a
# user-defined configuration file if the original list of allowed settings is
# secure.

# STARTFILE is the default starting URL if none is specified
#   on the command line or via a WWW_HOME environment variable;
#   Lynx will refuse to start without a starting URL of some kind.
# STARTFILE can be remote, e.g. http://www.w3.org/default.html ,
#                or local, e.g. file://localhost/PATH_TO/FILENAME ,
#           where PATH_TO is replaced with the complete path to FILENAME
#           using Unix shell syntax and including the device on VMS.
#
# Normally we expect you will connect to a remote site, e.g., the Lynx starting
# site:
STARTFILE:http://lynx.browser.org/
#
# As an alternative, you may want to use a local URL.  A good choice for this is
# the user's home directory:
#STARTFILE:file://localhost/~/
#
# Your choice of STARTFILE should reflect your site's needs, and be a URL that
# you can connect to reliably.  Otherwise users will become confused and think
# that they cannot run Lynx.

# HELPFILE must be defined as a URL and must have a
# complete path if local:
# file://localhost/PATH_TO/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html
#   Replace PATH_TO with the path to the lynx_help subdirectory
#   for this distribution (use SHELL syntax including the device
#   on VMS systems).
# The default HELPFILE is:
# http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html
#   This should be changed to the local path.
#
HELPFILE:http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html
#HELPFILE:file://localhost/PATH_TO/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html

# DEFAULT_INDEX_FILE is the default file retrieved when the
# user presses the 'I' key when viewing any document.
# An index to your CWIS can be placed here or a document containing
# pointers to lots of interesting places on the web.
#
DEFAULT_INDEX_FILE:http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/MetaIndex.html

# Set GOTOBUFFER to TRUE if you want to have the previous goto URL,
# if any, offered for reuse or editing when using the 'g'oto command.
# The default is defined in userdefs.h.  If left FALSE, the circular
# buffer of previously entered goto URLs can still be invoked via the
# Up-Arrow or Down-Arrow keys after entering the 'g'oto command.
#
#GOTOBUFFER:FALSE

# JUMP_PROMPT is the default statusline prompt for selecting a jumps file
# shortcut.  (see below).
# You can change the prompt here from that defined in userdefs.h.  Any
# trailing white space will be trimmed, and a single space is added by Lynx
# following the last non-white character.  You must set the default prompt
# before setting the default jumps file (below).  If a default jumps file
# was set via userdefs.h, and you change the prompt here, you must set the
# default jumps file again (below) for the change to be implemented.
#
#JUMP_PROMPT:Jump to (use '?' for list):

# JUMPFILE is the local file checked for short-cut names for URLs
# when the user presses the 'j' (JUMP) key.  The user will be prompted
# to enter a short-cut name for an URL, which Lynx will then follow
# in a similar manner to 'g'oto; alternatively, s/he can enter '?'
# to view the full JUMPFILE list of short-cuts with associated URLs.
# There is an example jumps file in the samples subdirectory.
# If not defined here or in  userdefs.h , the JUMP command will invoke
# the NO_JUMPFILE statusline message (cp  LYMessages_en.h ).
#
# To allow '?' to work, include in the JUMPFILE
# a short-cut to the JUMPFILE itself, e.g.
# <dt>?<dd><a href="file://localhost/path/jumps.html">This Shortcut List</a>
#
# On VMS, use Unix SHELL syntax (including a lead slash) to define it.
#
# Additional jumps files can be defined and mapped to keystrokes
# in  lynx.cfg , but you should first define the default jumps file,
# which is mapped by default to 'j' (or 'J' when VI keys are ON).
#
# In the following line, include the actual full local path to JUMPFILE,
# but do not include 'file://localhost' in the line.
#JUMPFILE:/FULL_LOCAL_PATH/jumps.html

# Set JUMPBUFFER to TRUE if you want to have the previous jump target,
# if any, offered for reuse or editing when using the 'J'ump command.
# The default is defined in userdefs.h.  If left FALSE, the circular
# buffer of previously entered targets (shortcuts) can still be invoked
# via the Up-Arrow or Down-Arrow keys after entering the 'J'ump command.
# If multiple jumps files are installed, the recalls of shortcuts will
# be specific to each file.  If Lynx was built with PERMIT_GOTO_FROM_JUMP
# defined, any random URLs used instead of shortcuts will be stored in the
# goto URL buffer, not in the shortcuts buffer(s), and the single character
# ':' can be used as a target to invoke the goto URL buffer (as if 'g'oto
# followed by Up-Arrow had been entered).
#
#JUMPBUFFER:FALSE

# If SAVE_SPACE is defined, it will be used as a path prefix for the
# suggested filename in "Save to Disk" operations from the 'p'rint or
# 'd'ownload menus.  On VMS, you can use either VMS (e.g., "SYS$LOGIN:")
# or Unix syntax (including '~' for the HOME directory).  On Unix, you
# must use Unix syntax.  If the symbol is not defined, or is zero-length
# (""), no prefix will be used, and only a filename for saving in the
# current default directory will be suggested.
# This definition will be overridden if a "LYNX_SAVE_SPACE" environment
# variable has been set on Unix, or logical has been defined on VMS.
#
#SAVE_SPACE:~/foo/

# If LYNX_HOST_NAME is defined here or in userdefs.h, it will be
# treated as an alias for the local host name in checks for URLs on
# the local host (e.g., when the -localhost switch is set), and this
# host name, "localhost", and HTHostName (the fully qualified domain
# name of the system on which Lynx is running) will all be passed as
# local.  A different definition here will override that in userdefs.h.
#
#LYNX_HOST_NAME:www.cc.ukans.edu

# localhost aliases
# Any LOCALHOST_ALIAS definitions also will be accepted as local when
# the -localhost switch is set.  These need not actually be local, i.e.,
# in contrast to LYNX_HOST_NAME, you can define them to trusted hosts at
# other Internet sites.
#
#LOCALHOST_ALIAS:gopher.server.domain
#LOCALHOST_ALIAS:news.server.domain

# LOCAL_DOMAIN is used for a tail match with the ut_host element of
# the utmp or utmpx structure on systems with utmp capabilities, to
# determine if a user is local to your campus or organization when
# handling -restrictions=inside_foo or outside_foo settings for ftp,
# news, telnet/tn3270 and rlogin URLs.  An "inside" user is assumed
# if your system does not have utmp capabilities.  CHANGE THIS here
# if it was not changed in userdefs.h at compilation time.
#
#LOCAL_DOMAIN:ukans.edu

# CHARACTER_SET defines the display character set, i.e., assumed to be
# installed on the user's terminal.  It determines which characters or strings
# will be used to represent 8-bit character entities within HTML.  New
# character sets may be defined as explained in the README files of the
# src/chrtrans directory in the Lynx source code distribution.  For Asian (CJK)
# character sets, it also determines how Kanji code will be handled.  The
# default is defined in userdefs.h and can be changed here or via the
# 'o'ptions menu.  The 'o'ptions menu setting will be stored in the user's RC
# file whenever those settings are saved, and thereafter will be used as the
# default.  For Lynx a "character set" has two names:  a MIME name (for
# recognizing properly labeled charset parameters in HTTP headers etc.), and a
# human-readable string for the 'O'ptions Menu (so you may find info about
# language or group of languages besides MIME name).  Not all 'human-readable'
# names correspond to exactly one valid MIME charset (example is "Chinese");
# in that case an appropriate valid (and more specific) MIME name should be
# used where required.  Well-known synonyms are also processed in the code.
#
# Raw (CJK) mode
#
# Lynx normally translates characters from a document's charset to display
# charset, using ASSUME_CHARSET value (see below) if the document's charset
# is not specified explicitly.  Raw (CJK) mode is OFF for this case.
# When the document charset is specified explicitly, that charset
# overrides any assumption like ASSUME_CHARSET or raw (CJK) mode.
#
# For the Asian (CJK) display character sets, the corresponding charset is
# assumed in documents, i.e., raw (CJK) mode is ON by default.  In raw CJK
# mode, 8-bit characters are not reverse translated in relation to the entity
# conversion arrays, i.e., they are assumed to be appropriate for the display
# character set.  The mode should be toggled OFF when an Asian (CJK) display
# character set is selected but the document is not CJK and its charset not
# specified explicitly.
#
# Raw (CJK) mode may be toggled by user via '@' (LYK_RAW_TOGGLE) key,
# the -raw command line switch or from the 'o'ptions menu.
#
# Raw (CJK) mode effectively changes the charset assumption about unlabeled
# documents.  You can toggle raw mode ON if you believe the document has a
# charset which does correspond to your Display Character Set.  On the other
# hand, if you set ASSUME_CHARSET the same as Display Character Set you get raw
# mode ON by default (but you get assume_charset=iso-8859-1 if you try raw mode
# OFF after it).
#
# Note that "raw" does not mean that every byte will be passed to the screen.
# HTML character entities may get expanded and translated, inappropriate
# control characters filtered out, etc.  There is a "Transparent" pseudo
# character set for more "rawness".
#
# Since Lynx now supports a wide range of platforms it may be useful to note
# the cpXXX codepages used by IBM PC compatible computers, and windows-xxxx
# used by native MS-Windows apps.  We also note that cpXXX pages rarely are
# found on Internet, but are mostly for local needs on DOS.
#

#
#CHARACTER_SET:iso-8859-1

# ASSUME_CHARSET changes the handling of documents which do not
# explicitly specify a charset.  Normally Lynx assumes that 8-bit
# characters in those documents are encoded according to iso-8859-1
# (the official default for the HTTP protocol).  When ASSUME_CHARSET
# is defined here or by an -assume_charset command line flag is in effect,
# Lynx will treat documents as if they were encoded accordingly.
# See above on how this interacts with "raw mode" and the Display
# Character Set.
# ASSUME_CHARSET can also be changed via the 'o'ptions menu but will
# not be saved as permanent value in user's .lynxrc file to avoid more chaos.
#
#ASSUME_CHARSET:iso-8859-1

# ASSUME_LOCAL_CHARSET is like ASSUME_CHARSET but only applies to local
# files.  If no setting is given here or by an -assume_local_charset
# command line option, the value for ASSUME_CHARSET or -assume_charset
# is used.  It works for both text/plain and text/html files.
# This option will ignore "raw mode" toggling when local files are viewed
# (it is "stronger" than "assume_charset" or the effective change
# of the charset assumption caused by changing "raw mode"),
# so only use when necessary.
#
#ASSUME_LOCAL_CHARSET:iso-8859-1

# PREPEND_CHARSET_TO_SOURCE:TRUE tells Lynx to prepend a META CHARSET line
# to text/html source files when they are retrieved for 'd'ownloading
# or passed to 'p'rint functions, so HTTP headers will not be lost.
# This is necessary for resolving charset for local html files,
# while the assume_local_charset is just an assumption.
# For the 'd'ownload option, a META CHARSET will be added only if the HTTP
# charset is present.  The compilation default is TRUE.
# It is generally desirable to have charset information for every local
# html file, but META CHARSET string potentially could cause
# compatibility problems with other browsers, see also PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE.
# Note that the prepending is not done for -source dumps.
#
#PREPEND_CHARSET_TO_SOURCE:TRUE

# NCR_IN_BOOKMARKS:TRUE allows you to save 8-bit characters in bookmark titles
# in the unicode format (NCR).  This may be useful if you need to switch
# display charsets frequently.  This is the case when you use Lynx on different
# platforms, e.g., on UNIX and from a remote PC, and want to keep the bookmarks
# file persistent.
# Another aspect is compatibility:  NCR is part of I18N and HTML4.0
# specifications supported starting with Lynx 2.7.2, Netscape 4.0 and MSIE 4.0.
# Older browser versions will fail so keep NCR_IN_BOOKMARKS:FALSE if you
# plan to use them.
#
#NCR_IN_BOOKMARKS:FALSE

# FORCE_8BIT_TOUPPER overrides locale settings and uses internal 8-bit
# case-conversion mechanism for case-insensitive searches in non-ASCII display
# character sets.  It is FALSE by default and should not be changed unless
# you encounter problems with case-insensitive searches.
#
#FORCE_8BIT_TOUPPER:FALSE

# While Lynx supports different platforms and display character sets
# we need to limit the charset in outgoing mail to reduce
# trouble for remote recipients who may not recognize our charset.
# You may try US-ASCII as the safest value (7 bit), any other MIME name,
# or leave this field blank (default) to use the display character set.
# Charset translations currently are implemented for mail "subjects= " only.
#
#OUTGOING_MAIL_CHARSET:

# If Lynx encounters a charset parameter it doesn't recognize, it will
# replace the value given by ASSUME_UNREC_CHARSET (or a corresponding
# -assume_unrec_charset command line option) for it.  This can be used
# to deal with charsets unknown to Lynx, if they are "sufficiently
# similar" to one that Lynx does know about, by forcing the same
# treatment.  There is no default, and you probably should leave this
# undefined unless necessary.
#
#ASSUME_UNREC_CHARSET:iso-8859-1

# PREFERRED_LANGUAGE is the language in MIME notation (e.g., "en",
# "fr") which will be indicated by Lynx in its Accept-Language headers
# as the preferred language.  If available, the document will be
# transmitted in that language.  Users can override this setting via
# the 'o'ptions menu and save that preference in their RC file.
# This may be a comma-separated list of languages in decreasing preference.
#
#PREFERRED_LANGUAGE:en

# PREFERRED_CHARSET specifies the character set in MIME notation (e.g.,
# "ISO-8859-2", "ISO-8859-5") which Lynx will indicate you prefer in
# requests to http servers using an Accept-Charsets header.  Users can
# change it via the 'o'ptions menu and save that preference in their RC file.
# The value should NOT include "ISO-8859-1" or "US-ASCII",
# since those values are always assumed by default.
# If a file in that character set is available, the server will send it.
# If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
# character set is acceptable.  If an Accept-Charset header is present,
# and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
# according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send
# an error response with the 406 (not acceptable) status code, though
# the sending of an unacceptable response is also allowed.  See RFC 2068
# (http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc2068.txt).
#
#PREFERRED_CHARSET:

# URL_DOMAIN_PREFIXES and URL_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES are strings which will be
# prepended (together with a scheme://) and appended to the first element
# of command line or 'g'oto arguments which are not complete URLs and
# cannot be opened as a local file (file://localhost/string).  Both
# can be comma-separated lists.  Each prefix must end with a dot, each
# suffix must begin with a dot, and either may contain other dots (e.g.,
# .com.jp).  The default lists are defined in userdefs.h and can be
# replaced here.  Each prefix will be used with each suffix, in order,
# until a valid Internet host is created, based on a successful DNS
# lookup (e.g., foo will be tested as www.foo.com and then www.foo.edu
# etc.).  The first element can include a :port and/or /path which will
# be restored with the expanded host (e.g., wfbr:8002/dir/lynx will
# become http://www.wfbr.edu:8002/dir/lynx).  The prefixes will not be
# used if the first element ends in a dot (or has a dot before the
# :port or /path), and similarly the suffixes will not be used if the
# the first element begins with a dot (e.g., .nyu.edu will become
# http://www.nyu.edu without testing www.nyu.com).  Lynx will try to
# guess the scheme based on the first field of the expanded host name,
# and use "http://" as the default (e.g., gopher.wfbr.edu or gopher.wfbr.
# will be made gopher://gopher.wfbr.edu).
#
#URL_DOMAIN_PREFIXES:www.
#URL_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES:.com,.edu,.net,.org

# The following three definitions set the number of seconds for
# pauses following statusline messages that would otherwise be
# replaced immediately, and are more important than the unpaused
# progress messages.  Those set by INFOSECS are also basically
# progress messages (e.g., that a prompted input has been canceled)
# and should have the shortest pause.  Those set by MESSAGESECS are
# informational (e.g., that a function is disabled) and should have
# a pause of intermediate duration.  Those set by ALERTSECS typically
# report a serious problem and should be paused long enough to read
# whenever they appear (typically unexpectedly).  The default values
# are defined in userdefs.h, and can be modified here should longer
# pauses be desired for braille-based access to Lynx.

# If USE_SELECT_POPUPS is set FALSE, Lynx will present a vertical list of
# radio buttons for the OPTIONs in SELECT blocks which lack the MULTIPLE
# attribute, instead of using a popup menu.  Note that if the MULTIPLE
# attribute is present in the SELECT start tag, Lynx always will create a
# vertical list of checkboxes for the OPTIONs.
# The default defined here or in userdefs.h can be changed via the 'o'ptions
# menu and saved in the RC file, and always can be toggled via the -popup
# command line switch.
#
#USE_SELECT_POPUPS:TRUE

# SHOW_CURSOR controls whether or not the cursor is hidden or appears
# over the current link in documents or the current option in popups.
# Showing the cursor is handy if you are a sighted user with a poor
# terminal that can't do bold and reverse video at the same time or
# at all.  It also can be useful to blind users, as an alternative
# or supplement to setting LINKS_AND_FORM_FIELDS_ARE_NUMBERED or
# LINKS_ARE_NUMBERED.
# The default defined here or in userdefs.h can be changed via the
# 'o'ptions menu and saved in the RC file, and always can be toggled
# via the -show_cursor command line switch.
#
#SHOW_CURSOR:FALSE

# VERBOSE_IMAGES controls whether or not Lynx replaces the [LINK], [INLINE] and
# [IMAGE] comments (for images without ALT) with filenames of these images.
# This can be useful in determining what images are decorations

# If BOLD_HEADERS is set to TRUE the HT_BOLD default style will be acted
# upon for <H1> through <H6> headers.  The compilation default is FALSE
# (only the indentation styles are acted upon, but see BOLD_H1, below).
# On Unix, compilation with -DUNDERLINE_LINKS also will apply to the
# HT_BOLD style for headers when BOLD_HEADERS is TRUE.

# The DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE specifies the number of WWW documents to be
# cached in memory at one time.
#
# This so-called cache size (actually, number) is defined in userdefs.h and
# may be modified here and/or with the command line argument -cache=NUMBER
# The minimum allowed value is 2, for the current document and at least one
# to fetch, and there is no absolute maximum number of cached documents.
# On Unix, and VMS not compiled with VAXC, whenever the number is exceeded
# the least recently displayed document will be removed from memory.
#
# On VMS compiled with VAXC, the DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE specifies the
# amount (bytes) of virtual memory that can be allocated and not yet be freed
# before previous documents are removed from memory.  If the values for both
# the DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE and DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE are exceeded, then
# the least recently displayed documents will be freed until one or the other
# value is no longer exceeded.  The default value is defined in userdefs.h.
#
# The Unix and VMS (but not VAXC) implementations use the C library malloc's
# and calloc's for memory allocation, but procedures for taking the actual
# amount of cache into account still need to be developed.  They use only
# the DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE value, and that specifies the absolute maximum
# number of documents to cache (rather than the maximum number only if
# DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE has been exceeded, as with VAXC/VAX).
#
#DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE:10
#DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE:512000

# SOURCE_CACHE sets the source caching behavior for Lynx:
# FILE causes Lynx to keep a temporary file for each cached document
#   containing the HTML source of the document, which it uses to regenerate
#   the document when certain settings are changed (for instance,
#   historical vs. minimal vs. valid comment parsing) instead of reloading
#   the source from the network.
# MEMORY is like FILE, except the document source is kept in memory.  You
#   may wish to adjust DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE and DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE
#   accordingly.
# NONE is the default; the document source is not cached, and is reloaded
#   from the network when needed.
#
#SOURCE_CACHE:NONE

# If ALWAYS_RESUBMIT_POSTS is set TRUE, Lynx always will resubmit forms
# with method POST, dumping any cache from a previous submission of the
# form, including when the document returned by that form is sought with
# the PREV_DOC command or via the history list.  Lynx always resubmits
# forms with method POST when a submit button or a submitting text input
# is activated, but normally retrieves the previously returned document
# if it had links which you activated, and then go back with the PREV_DOC
# command or via the history list.
#
# The default defined here or in userdefs.h can be toggled via
# the -resubmit_forms command line switch.
#
#ALWAYS_RESUBMIT_POSTS:FALSE

# If NO_ISMAP_IF_USEMAP is set TRUE, Lynx will not include a link to the
# server-side image map if both a server-side and client-side map for the
# same image is indicated in the HTML markup.  The compilation default is
# FALSE, such that a link with "[ISMAP]" as the link name, followed by a
# hyphen, will be prepended to the ALT string or "[USEMAP]" pseudo-ALT for
# accessing Lynx's text-based rendition of the client-side map (based on
# the content of the associated MAP element).  If the "[ISMAP]" link is
# activated, Lynx will send a 0,0 coordinate pair to the server, which
# Lynx-friendly sites can map to a for-text-client document, homologous
# to what is intended for the content of a FIG element.
#
# The compilation default, or default defined here, can be toggled via
# the "-ismap" command line switch.
#
#NO_ISMAP_IF_USEMAP:FALSE

# If SEEK_FRAG_MAP_IN_CUR is set FALSE, then USEMAP attribute values
# (in IMG or OBJECT tags) consisting of only a fragment (USEMAP="#foo")
# will be resolved with respect to the current document's base, which
# might not be the same as the current document's URL.
# The compilation default is to use the current document's URL in all
# cases (i.e., assume the MAP is present below, if it wasn't present
# above the point in the HTML stream where the USEMAP attribute was
# detected).  Lynx's present "single pass" rendering engine precludes
# checking below before making the decision on how to resolve a USEMAP
# reference consisting solely of a fragment.
#
#SEEK_FRAG_MAP_IN_CUR:TRUE

# If SEEK_FRAG_AREA_IN_CUR is set FALSE, then HREF attribute values
# in AREA tags consisting of only a fragment (HREF="#foo") will be
# resolved with respect to the current document's base, which might
# not be the same as the current document's URL.  The compilation
# default is to use the current document's URL, as is done for the
# HREF attribute values of Anchors and LINKs that consist solely of
# a fragment.
#
#SEEK_FRAG_AREA_IN_CUR:TRUE

# Local execution links and scripts are by default completely disabled
# unless a change is made to the userdefs.h file to enabled them.
# See the Lynx source code distribution and the userdefs.h
# file for more detail on enabling execution links and scripts.
#
# If you have enabled execution links or scripts the following
# two variables control Lynx's action when an execution link
# or script is encountered.
#
# If LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ALWAYS_ON is set to TRUE any execution
# link or script will be executed no matter where it came from.
# This is EXTREMELY dangerous.  Since Lynx can access files from
# anywhere in the world, you may encounter links or scripts that
# will cause damage or compromise the security of your system.
#
# If LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ON_BUT_NOT_REMOTE is set to TRUE only
# links or scripts that reside on the local machine and are
# referenced with a URL beginning with "file://localhost/" or meet
# TRUSTED_EXEC or ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC rules (see below) will be
# executed.  This is much less dangerous than enabling all execution
# links, but can still be dangerous.
#
#LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ALWAYS_ON:FALSE
#LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ON_BUT_NOT_REMOTE:FALSE

# If LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINK_ON_BUT_NOT_REMOTE is TRUE, and no TRUSTED_EXEC
# rule is defined, it defaults to "file://localhost/" and any lynxexec
# or lynxprog command will be permitted if it was referenced with a URL
# beginning with that string.  If you wish to restrict the referencing URLs
# further, you can extend the string to include a trusted path.  You also can
# specify a trusted directory for http URLs, which will then be treated as
# if they were local rather than remote.  For example:
#
#	TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/trusted/
#	TRUSTED_EXEC:http://www.wfbr.edu/trusted/
#
# If you also wish to restrict the commands which can be executed, create
# a series of rules with the path (Unix) or command name (VMS) following
# the string, separated by a tab.  For example:
#
# Unix:
#	TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/<tab>/bin/cp
#	TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/<tab>/bin/rm
# VMS:
#	TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/<tab>copy
#	TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/<tab>delete
#
# Once you specify a TRUSTED_EXEC referencing string, the default is
# replaced, and all the referencing strings you desire must be specified
# as a series.  Similarly, if you associate a command with the referencing
# string, you must specify all of the allowable commands as a series of
# TRUSTED_EXEC rules for that string.  If you specify ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC
# rules below, you need not repeat them as TRUSTED_EXEC rules.
#
# If EXEC_LINKS and JUMPFILE have been defined, any lynxexec or lynxprog
# URLs in that file will be permitted, regardless of other settings.  If
# you also set LOCAL_EXECUTION_LINKS_ON_BUT_NOT_REMOTE:TRUE and a single
# TRUSTED_EXEC rule that will always fail (e.g., "none"), then *ONLY* the
# lynxexec or lynxprog URLs in JUMPFILE (and any ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC rules,
# see below) will be allowed.  Note, however, that if Lynx was compiled with
# CAN_ANONYMOUS_JUMP set to FALSE (default is TRUE), or -restrictions=jump
# is included with the -anonymous switch at run time, then users of an
# anonymous account will not be able to access the jumps file or enter
# 'j'ump shortcuts, and this selective execution feature will be overridden
# as well (i.e., they will only be able to access lynxexec or lynxprog
# URLs which meet any ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC rules).
#
#TRUSTED_EXEC:none

# If EXEC_LINKS was defined, any lynxexec or lynxprog URL can be made
# always enabled by an ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC rule for it.  This is useful for
# anonymous accounts in which you have disabled execution links generally,
# and may also have disabled jumps file links, but still want to allow
# execution of particular utility scripts or programs.  The format is
# like that for TRUSTED_EXEC.  For example:
#
# Unix:
#   ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/<tab>/usr/local/kinetic/bin/usertime
#   ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC:http://www.more.net/<tab>/usr/local/kinetic/bin/who.sh
# VMS:
#   ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC:file://localhost/<tab>usertime
#   ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC:http://www.more.net/<tab>show users
#
# The default ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC rule is "none".

#ALWAYS_TRUSTED_EXEC:none

# Unix:

# TRUSTED_LYNXCGI rules define the permitted sources and/or paths for

# To enable news reading ability via Lynx, the environment variable NNTPSERVER
# must be set so that it points to your site's NNTP server
# (see Lynx Users Guide on environment variables).
# Lynx respects RFC 1738 (http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc1738.txt)
# and does not accept a host field in news URLs (use nntp: instead of news: for
# the scheme if you wish to specify an NNTP host in a URL, as explained in the
# RFC).  If you have not set the variable externally, you can set it at run
# time via this configuration file.  It will not override an external setting.
# Note that on VMS it is set as a process logical rather than symbol, and will
# outlive the Lynx image.
# The news reading facility in Lynx is quite limited.  Lynx does not provide a
# full featured news reader with elaborate error checking and safety features.

#
#LIST_NEWS_DATES:FALSE

# NEWS_CHUNK_SIZE and NEWS_MAX_CHUNK regulate the chunking of news article
# listings with inclusion of links for listing earlier and/or later articles.
# The defaults are defined in HTNews.c as 30 and 40, respectively.  If the
# news group contains more than NEWS_MAX_CHUNK articles, they will be listed
# in NEWS_CHUNK_SIZE chunks.  You can change the defaults here, and/or on
# the command line via -newschunksize=NUMBER and/or -newsmaxchunk=NUMBER
# switches.  Note that if the chunk size is increased, here or on the command
# line, to a value greater than the current maximum, the maximum will be
# increased to that number.  Conversely, if the maximum is set to a number
# less than the current chunk size, the chunk size will be reduced to that
# number.  Thus, you need use only one of the two switches on the command
# line, based on the direction of intended change relative to the compilation
# or configuration defaults.  The compilation defaults ensure that there will
# be at least 10 earlier articles before bothering to chunk and create a link
# for earlier articles.
#
#NEWS_CHUNK_SIZE:30

# Set NEWS_POSTING to FALSE if you do not want to support posting to

# posts will be attempted via the nntp server specified in the URL, or
# if none was specified, via the NNTPSERVER configuration or environment
# variable.  Links with these URLs for posting or sending followups are
# created by the news gateway when reading group listings or articles
# from nntp servers if the server indicates that it permits posting.
# The compilation default set in userdefs.h can be changed here.  If

# ./BM/lynx_bookmarks.html), but the subdirectory must already exist.
# Lynx will create the bookmark file, if it does not already exist, on
# the first ADD_BOOKMARK attempt if the HOME directory is indicated
# (i.e., if the definition is just filename.html without any slashes),
# but requires a pre-existing subdirectory to create the file there.

# NOTE: Do not define an editor unless you know that every user will
#       know how to use it.  Most users do not enjoy getting stuck in
#       an unknown editor that they can't exit.  Users can

# The no_proxy variable can be a comma-separated list of strings defining
# no-proxy zones in the DNS domain name space.  If a tail substring of the
# domain-path for a host matches one of these strings, transactions with that
# node will not be proxied.
#no_proxy:domain.path1,path2
#
# A single asterisk as an entry will override all proxy variables and no
# transactions will be proxied.
#no_proxy:*
# This is the only allowed use of * in no_proxy.
#
# Warning:  Note that setting 'il' as an entry in this list will block proxying
# for the .mil domain as well as the .il domain.  If the entry is '.il' this
# will not happen.

# PRINTER & DOWNLOADER DEFINITIONS:
# Lynx has 4 pre-defined print options & 1 pre-defined download option,
# which are called up on-screen when `p' or `d' are entered;
# any number of options can be added by the user, as explained below.
#
# For `p' pre-defined options are: `Save to local file', `E-mail the file',
# `Print to screen' and `Print to local printer attached to vt100'.
# `Print to screen' allows file transfers in the absence of alternatives
# and is often the only option allowed here for anonymous users;
# the 3rd & 4th options are not pre-defined for DOS/WINDOWS versions of Lynx.
# For `d' the pre-defined option is: `Download to local file'.
#
# To define your own print or download option use the following formats:
# PRINTER:<name>:<command>:<option>:<lines/page>
# DOWNLOADER:<name>:<command>:<option>
#
# <name>       is what you will see on the print/download screen.
# <command>    is the command your system will execute:
#              the 1st %s in the command will be replaced
#              by the temporary filename used by Lynx;
#              a 2nd %s will be replaced by a filename of your choice,
#              for which Lynx will prompt, offering a suggestion;
#              if the command format of your printer/downloader requires
#              a different layout, you will need to use a script
#              (see the last 2 download examples below).
# <option>     TRUE : the printer/downloader will always be ENABLED,
#              except that downloading is disabled when -validate is used;
#              FALSE : both will be DISABLED for anonymous users
#              and printing will be disabled when -noprint is used.
# <lines/page> (printers: optional) the number of lines/page (default 66):
#              used to compute the approximate output size
#              and prompt if the document is > 4 printer pages;
#              it uses current screen length for the computation
#              when `Print to screen' is selected.
#
# You must put the whole definition on one line;
# if you use a colon, precede it with a backslash.
#
# `Printer' can be any file-handling program you find useful,
# even if it does not physically print anything.
#
# Usually, downloading involves the use of (e.g.) Ckermit or ZModem
# to transfer files to a user's local machine over a serial link,
# but download options do not have to be download-protocol programs.
#
# Printer examples:
#PRINTER:Computer Center printer:lpr -Pccprt %s:FALSE
#PRINTER:Office printer:lpr -POffprt %s:TRUE
#PRINTER:VMS printer:print /queue=cc$print %s:FALSE:58
# If you have a very busy VMS print queue
# and Lynx deletes the temporary files before they have been queued,
# use the VMSPrint.com included in the distribution:
#PRINTER:Busy VMS printer:@Lynx_Dir\:VMSPrint sys$print %s:FALSE:58
# To specify a print option at run-time:
# NBB if you have ANONYMOUS users, DO NOT allow this option!
#PRINTER:Specify at run-time:echo -n "Enter a print command\: "; read word; sh -c "$word %s":FALSE
# To pass to a sophisticated file viewer: -k suppresses invocation
# of hex display mode if 8-bit or control characters are present;
# +s invokes secure mode (see ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/most):
#PRINTER:Use Most to view:most -k +s %s:TRUE:23
#
# Downloader examples:
# in Kermit, -s %s is the filename sent, -a %s the filename on arrival
# (if they are given in reverse order here, the command will fail):
#DOWNLOADER:Use Kermit to download to the terminal:kermit -i -s %s -a %s:TRUE
# NB don't use -k with Most, so that binaries will invoke hexadecimal mode:
#DOWNLOADER:Use Most to view:most +s %s:TRUE
# The following example gives wrong filenames
# (`sz' doesn't support a suggested filename parameter):
#DOWNLOADER:Use Zmodem to download to the local terminal:sz %s:TRUE
# The following example returns correct filenames
# by using a script to make a subdirectory in /tmp,
# but may conflict with very strong security or permissions restrictions:
#DOWNLOADER:Use Zmodem to download to the local terminal:set %s %s;td=/tmp/Lsz$$;mkdir $td;ln -s $1 $td/"$2";sz $td/"$2";rm -r $td:TRUE

# Note for OS/390: The following is strongly recommended  /* S/390 -- gil -- 1464 */
# to undo ASCII->EBCDIC conversion.
#
#DOWNLOADER:Save OS/390 binary file: iconv -f IBM-1047 -t ISO8859-1 %s >%s:FALSE

# Unix ONLY:
#===========
# Uploader definitions (implemented only with Unix DIRED_SUPPORT;
#                       see the Makefile in the top directory,
#			and the header of ./src/LYUpload.c)
# any number of uploaders may be defined by using multiple
# uploader definition sets.  Uploaders may be any programs
# that could be useful to your users; they do not necessarily
# have to be upload protocol programs.  The most common use
# of an uploader is to use Ckermit or some other transfer
# program so that the user may easily transfer files from
# their local machine over a serial link.
#
# the definition of an uploader is of the same form as a downloader
# UPLOADER:<uploadername>:<uploader command>:<uploader option>
#
#  You must put the whole definition on one line.
#
#  If you must use a colon, precede it with a backslash!
#
#  If you do not include a %s, you will not be prompted for an
#  output filename.
#
#    example
#UPLOADER:Use Kermit to upload from your computer: kermit -i -r -a %s:TRUE
#UPLOADER:Use Zmodem to upload from your computer: rz %s:TRUE

# If NO_DOT_FILES is TRUE (normal default via userdefs.h), the user will not
# be allowed to specify files beginning with a dot in reply to output filename
# prompts, and files beginning with a dot (e.g., file://localhost/path/.lynxrc)
# will not be included in the directory browser's listings.  If set FALSE, you
# can force it to be treated as TRUE via -restrictions=dotfiles.  If set FALSE
# and not forced TRUE, the user can regulate it via the 'o'ptions menu (and
# may save the preference in the RC file).
#
#NO_DOT_FILES:TRUE

# If NO_FROM_HEADER is set FALSE, From headers will be sent in transmissions
# to http or https servers if the personal_mail_address has been defined via
# the 'o'ptions menu.  The compilation default is TRUE (no From header is
# sent) and the default can be changed here.  The default can be toggled at
# run time via the -from switch.  Note that transmissions of From headers
# have become widely considered to create an invasion of privacy risk.
#
#NO_FROM_HEADER:TRUE

# If NO_REFERER_HEADER is TRUE, Referer headers never will be sent in
# transmissions to servers.  Lynx normally sends the URL of the document
# from which the link was derived, but not for startfile URLs, 'g'oto
# URLs, 'j'ump shortcuts, bookmark file links, history list links, or
# URLs that include the content from form submissions with method GET.
# If left FALSE here, it can be set TRUE at run time via the -noreferer
# switch.
#
#NO_REFERER_HEADER:FALSE

# If NO_FILE_REFERER is TRUE, Referer headers never will be sent in
# transmissions to servers for links or actions derived from documents
# or forms with file URLs.  This would ensure that paths associated
# with the local file system are never indicated to servers, even if
# NO_REFERER_HEADER is FALSE.  If left FALSE here, it can be set TRUE
# at run time via the -nofilereferer switch.
#
#NO_FILE_REFERER:FALSE

# If MAKE_LINKS_FOR_ALL_IMAGES is TRUE, all images will be given links
# which can be ACTIVATEd.  For inlines, the ALT or pseudo-ALT ("[INLINE]")
# strings will be links for the resolved SRC rather than just text.  For
# ISMAP or other graphic links, the ALT or pseudo-ALT ("[ISMAP]" or "[LINK]")
# strings will have '-' and a link labeled "[IMAGE]" for the resolved SRC
# appended.  See also VERBOSE_IMAGES flag.
#
# The default defined here will override that in userdefs.h, and the user
# can use LYK_IMAGE_TOGGLE to toggle the feature on or off at run time.
#
# The default also can be toggled via an "-image_links" command line switch.
#
#MAKE_LINKS_FOR_ALL_IMAGES:FALSE

# If MAKE_PSEUDO_ALTS_FOR_INLINES is FALSE, inline images which do not
# specify an ALT string will not have "[INLINE]" inserted as a pseudo-ALT,
# i.e., they'll be treated as having ALT="".  If MAKE_LINKS_FOR_ALL_IMAGES
# is defined or toggled to TRUE, however, the pseudo-ALTs will be created
# for inlines, so that they can be used as links to the SRCs.
# See also VERBOSE_IMAGES flag.
#
# The default defined here will override that in userdefs.h, and the user
# can use LYK_INLINE_TOGGLE to toggle the feature on or off at run time.
#
# The default also can be toggled via a "-pseudo_inlines" command line
# switch.
#
#MAKE_PSEUDO_ALTS_FOR_INLINES:TRUE

# If SUBSTITUTE_UNDERSCORES is TRUE, the _underline_ format will be used
# for emphasis tags in dumps.
#
# The default defined here will override that in userdefs.h, and the user
# can toggle the default via a "-underscore" command line switch.
#
#SUBSTITUTE_UNDERSCORES:FALSE

# If QUIT_DEFAULT_YES is TRUE then when the QUIT command is entered, any
# response other than n or N will confirm.  It should be FALSE if you
# prefer the more conservative action of requiring an explicit Y or y to
# confirm.  The default defined here will override that in userdefs.h.
#
#QUIT_DEFAULT_YES:TRUE

# If HISTORICAL_COMMENTS is TRUE, Lynx will revert to the "Historical"
# behavior of treating any '>' as a terminator for comments, instead of
# seeking a valid '-->' terminator (note that white space can be present
# between the '--' and '>' in valid terminators).  The compilation default
# is FALSE.
#
# The compilation default, or default defined here, can be toggled via a
# "-historical" command line switch, and via the LYK_HISTORICAL command key.
#
#HISTORICAL_COMMENTS:FALSE

# If MINIMAL_COMMENTS is TRUE, Lynx will not use Valid comment parsing
# of '--' pairs as serial comments within an overall comment element,
# and instead will seek only a '-->' terminator for the overall comment
# element.  This emulates the Netscape v2.0 comment parsing bug, and
# will help Lynx cope with the use of dashes as "decorations", which
# consequently has become common in so-called "Enhanced for Netscape"
# pages.  Note that setting Historical comments on will override the
# Minimal or Valid setting.
#
# The compilation default for MINIMAL_COMMENTS is FALSE, but we'll
# set it TRUE here, until Netscape gets its comment parsing right,
# and "decorative" dashes cease to be so common.
#
# The compilation default, or default defined here, can be toggled via a
# "-minimal" command line switch, and via the LYK_MINIMAL command key.
#
MINIMAL_COMMENTS:TRUE

# If SOFT_DQUOTES is TRUE, Lynx will emulate the invalid behavior of
# treating '>' as a co-terminator of a double-quoted attribute value
# and the tag which contains it, as was done in old versions of Netscape
# and Mosaic.  The compilation default is FALSE.
#
# The compilation default, or default defined here, can be toggled via
# a "-soft_dquotes" command line switch.
#
#SOFT_DQUOTES:FALSE

# If STRIP_DOTDOT_URLS is TRUE, Lynx emulates the invalid behavior of many
# browsers to strip a leading "../" segment from relative URLs in HTML
# documents with a http or https base URL, if this would otherwise lead to
# an absolute URLs with those characters still in it.  Such URLs are normally
# erroneous and not what is intended by page authors.  Lynx will issue
# a warning message when this occurs.
#
# If STRIP_DOTDOT_URLS is FALSE, Lynx will use those URLs for requests
# without taking any special actions or issuing Warnings, in most cases
# this will result in an error response from the server.
#
# Note that Lynx never tries to fix similar URLs for protocols other than
# http and https, since they are less common and may actually be valid in
# some cases.
#
#STRIP_DOTDOT_URLS:TRUE

# If ENABLE_SCROLLBACK is TRUE, Lynx will clear the entire screen before
# displaying each new screenful of text.  Though less efficient for normal
# use, this allows programs that maintain a buffer of previously-displayed
# text to recognize the continuity of what has been displayed, so that
# previous screenfuls can be reviewed by whatever method the program uses
# to scroll back through previous text.  For example, the PC comm program
# QModem has a key that can be pressed to scroll back; if ENABLE_SCROLLBACK
# is TRUE, pressing the scrollback key will access previous screenfuls which
# will have been stored on the local PC and will therefore be displayed
# instantaneously, instead of needing to be retransmitted by Lynx at the
# speed of the comm connection (but Lynx will not know about the change,
# so you must restore the last screen before resuming with Lynx commands).
#
# The compilation default is FALSE (if REVERSE_CLEAR_SCREEN_PROBLEM was not
# defined in the Unix Makefile to invoke this behavior as a workaround for
# some poor curses implementations).
#
# The default compilation or configuration setting can be toggled via an
# "-enable_scrollback" command line switch.
#
#ENABLE_SCROLLBACK:FALSE

# If SCAN_FOR_BURIED_NEWS_REFS is set to TRUE, Lynx will scan the bodies
# of news articles for buried article and URL references and convert them
# to links.  The compilation default is TRUE, but some email addresses
# enclosed in angle brackets ("<user@address>") might be converted to false
# news links, and uuencoded messages might be corrupted.  The conversion is
# not done when the display is toggled to source or when 'd'ownloading, so
# uuencoded articles can be saved intact regardless of these settings.
#
# The default setting can be toggled via a "-buried_news" command line
# switch.
#
#SCAN_FOR_BURIED_NEWS_REFS:TRUE

# If PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE is set to FALSE, Lynx will not prepend a
# Request URL comment and BASE element to text/html source files when
# they are retrieved for 'd'ownloading or passed to 'p'rint functions.
# The compilation default is TRUE.  Note that this prepending is not
# done for -source dumps, unless the -base switch also was included on
# the command line, and the latter switch overrides the setting of the
# PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE configuration variable.
#
#PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE:TRUE

# MIME types and viewers!
#
# file extensions may be assigned to MIME types using
# the SUFFIX: definition.
#
# NOTE: It is normally preferable to define new extension mappings in
#       EXTENSION_MAP files (see below) instead of here:  Definitions
#       here are overriden by those in EXTENSION_MAP files and even by
#       some built-in defaults in src/HTInit.c.
#       Extension mappings have an effect mostly for ftp and local files,
#       they are NOT used to determine the type of content for URLs with
#       the http protocol.  This is because HTTP servers already specify
#       the MIME type in the Content-Type header.  [It may still be
#       necessary to set up an appropriate suffix for some MIME types,
#       even if they are accessed only via the HTTP protocol, if the viewer
#       (see below) for those MIME types requires a certain suffix for the
#       temporary file passed to it.]
#
# The SUFFIX definition takes the form of:
#    SUFFIX:<file extension>:<mime type>
# for instance the following definition maps the
# extension ".gif" to the mime type "image/gif"
#    SUFFIX:.gif:image/gif
#
# file suffixes are case INsensitive!
#
# The suffix definitions listed here in the default lynx.cfg file are
# among those established via src/HTInit.c.  You can change any of the
# defaults by editing that file, or via the global or personal mime.types
# files at run time.  Assignments made here will be overridden by entries
# in those files.

#PERSONAL_EXTENSION_MAP:.mime.types
#	VMS (sought in user's sys$login directory):
#PERSONAL_EXTENSION_MAP:mime.types

# VMS:
# ====
# XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND will be used as a default in src/HTInit.c
# for viewing image content types when the DECW$DISPLAY logical
# is set.  Make it the foreign command for your system's X image
# viewer (commonly, "xv").  Make it "exit" or something like that
# if you don't have one.  It can be anything that will handle GIF,
# TIFF and other popular image formats.  Freeware ports of xv for
# VMS are available in the ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/unsupported and
# http://www.openvms.digital.com/cd/XV310A/ subdirectories.  You
# must also have a "%s" for the filename.  The default is defined
# in userdefs.h and can be overridden here, or via the global or
# personal mailcap files (see below).
#
#XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND:xv %s

# Unix:
# =====
# XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND will be used as a default in src/HTInit.c for
# viewing image content types when the DISPLAY environment variable
# is set.  Make it the full path and name of the xli (also know as
# xloadimage or xview) command, or other image viewer.  Put 'echo' or
# something like it here if you don't have a suitable viewer.  It can
# be anything that will handle GIF, TIFF and other popular image formats
# (xli does).  The freeware distribution of xli is available in the
# ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib subdirectory.  The shareware, xv, also is
# suitable.  You must also have a "%s" for the filename; "&" for
# background is optional.  The default is defined in userdefs.h and can be
# overridden here, or via the global or personal mailcap files (see below).
# Note that open is used as the default for NeXT, instead of the
# XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND definition.
# If you use xli, you may want to add the -quiet flag.
#
#XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND:xli %s &

# MIME types may be assigned to external viewers using
# the VIEWER definition.
#
# NOTE: if you do not define a viewer to a new MIME type
#       that you assigned above then it will be saved to
#       disk by default.
#       It is normally preferable to define new viewers in
#       MAILCAP files (see below) instead of here:  Definitions
#       here are overridden by those in MAILCAP files and even
#       by some built-in defaults in src/HTInit.c.
#
# The VIEWER definition takes the form of:
#    VIEWER:<mime type>:<viewer command>[:environment]
#      where -mime type is the MIME content type of the file
#	     -viewer command is a system command that can be
#             used to display the file where %s is replaced
#             within the command with the physical filename
#             (e.g., "ghostview %s" becomes "ghostview /tmp/temppsfile")
#            -environment is optional.  The only valid keywords
#             are currently XWINDOWS and NON_XWINDOWS.  If the XWINDOWS
#             environment is specified then the viewer will only be
#             defined when the user has the environment variable DISPLAY
#             (DECW$DISPLAY on VMS) defined.  If the NON_XWINDOWS environment
#             is specified the specified viewer will only be defined when the
#             user DOES NOT have the environment variable DISPLAY defined.
#  examples:
#		VIEWER:image/gif:xli %s:XWINDOWS
#               VIEWER:image/gif:ascii-view %s:NON_XWINDOWS
#               VIEWER:application/start-elm:elm
#
# You must put the whole definition on one line.
#
# If you must use a colon in the viewer command, precede it with a backslash!
#
# The MIME_type:viewer:XWINDOWS definitions listed here in the lynx.cfg
# file are among those established via src/HTInit.c.  For the image types,
# HTInit.c uses the XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND definition in userdefs.h or above
# (open is used for NeXT).  You can change any of these defaults via the
# global or personal mailcap files.  Assignments made here will be overridden
# by entries in those files.

# Key remapping definitions!
#
# You may redefine the keymapping of any function in Lynx by
# using the KEYMAP variable.  The form of KEYMAP is:
#  KEYMAP:<KEYSTROKE>:<LYNX FUNCTION>
#
# You must map upper and lowercase keys separately.
#
# A representative list of functions mapped to their default keys is
# provided below.  All of the mappings are commented out by default
# since they just repeat the default mappings, except for TOGGLE_HELP
# (see below).  See LYKeymap.c for the complete key mapping.  Use the
# 'K'eymap command when running Lynx for a list of the _current_ keymappings.
#
# (However, in contrast to the output of 'K' command,
# 'H'elp (lynx_help/*.html and lynx_help/keystrokes/*.html files) shows
# the default mapping unless you change that files manually,
# so you are responsible for possible deviations
# when you are changing any KEYMAP below).
#
#
# Keystrokes for special keys are represented by the following codes:

# VMS ONLY:
#==========
# On VMS, CSwing (an XTree emulation for VTxxx terminals) is intended for
# use as the Directory/File Manager (sources, objects, or executables are
# available from ftp://narnia.memst.edu/).  CSWING_PATH should be defined
# here or in userdefs.h to your foreign command for CSwing, with any
# regulatory switches you want included.  If not defined, or defined as
# a zero-length string ("") or "none" (case-insensitive), the support
# will be disabled.  It will also be disabled if the -nobrowse or
# -selective switches are used, or if the file_url restriction is set.
#
# When enabled, the DIRED_MENU command (normally 'f' or 'F') will invoke
# CSwing, normally with the current default directory as an argument to
# position the user on that node of the directory tree.  However, if the
# current document is a local directory listing, or a local file and not
# one of the temporary menu or list files, the associated directory will
# be passed as an argument, to position the user on that node of the tree.
#
#CSWING_PATH:swing

# Unix ONLY:
#===========
# LIST_FORMAT defines the display for local files when Lynx has been
# compiled with LONG_LIST defined in the Makefile.  The default is set
# in userdefs.h, normally to "ls -l" format, and can be changed here
# by uncommenting the indicated lines, or adding a definition with a
# modified parameter list.
#
# The percent items in the list are interpreted as follows:
#
#	%p	Unix-style permission bits
#	%l	link count
#	%o	owner of file
#	%g	group of file
#	%d	date of last modification
#	%a	anchor pointing to file or directory
#	%A	as above but don't show symbolic links
#	%t	type of file (description derived from MIME type)
#	%T	MIME type as known by Lynx (from mime.types or default)
#	%k	size of file in Kilobytes
#	%K	as above but omit size for directories
#	%s	size of file in bytes
#
# Anything between the percent and the letter is passed on to sprintf.
# A double percent yields a literal percent on output.  Other characters
# are passed through literally.
#
# If you want only the filename:
#
#LIST_FORMAT:    %a
#
# If you want a brief output:
#
#LIST_FORMAT:   %4K %-12.12d %a
#
# If you want the Unix "ls -l" format:
#
#LIST_FORMAT:    %p %4l %-8.8o %-8.8g %7s %-12.12d %a

# Unix ONLY:
#===========
# DIRED_MENU items are used to compose the F)ull menu list in DIRED mode
# The behavior of the default configuration given here is much the same
# as it was when this menu was hard-coded but these items can now be adjusted
# to suit local needs.  In particular, many of the LYNXDIRED actions can be
# replaced with lynxexec, lynxprog and lynxcgi script references.
#
# NOTE that defining even one DIRED_MENU line overrides all the built-in
# definitions, so a complete set must then be defined here.
#
# Each line consists of the following fields:
#
#	DIRED_MENU:type:suffix:link text:extra text:action
#
#	type: TAG:   list only when one or more files are tagged
#	      FILE:  list only when the current selection is a regular file
#	      DIR:   list only when the current selection is a directory
#	      LINK:  list only when the current selection is a symbolic link
#
#	suffix:  list only if the current selection ends in this pattern
#
#	link text:  the displayed text of the link
#
#	extra text:  the text displayed following the link
#
#	action:  the URL to be followed upon selection
#
#	link text and action are scanned for % sequences that are expanded
#	at display time as follows:
#
#			%p  path of current selection
#			%f  filename (last component) of current selection
#			%t  tagged list (full paths)
#			%l  list of tagged file names
#			%d  the current directory

# If NO_FORCED_CORE_DUMP is set to TRUE, Lynx will not force
# core dumps via abort() calls on fatal errors or assert()
# calls to check potentially fatal errors.  The compilation
# default normally is FALSE, and can be changed here.  The
# compilation or configuration default can be toggled via
# the -core command line switch.
# Note that this setting cannot be used to prevent core dumps
# with certainty.  If this is important, means provided by the
# operating system or kernel should be used.
#
#NO_FORCED_CORE_DUMP:FALSE

# COLORS (only available if compiled with SVr4 curses or slang)
#
# The line must be of the form:

#     1 - bold                 - hyperlinks, see also BOLD_* options above

# External application support.  This feature allows Lynx to pass a given
# URL to an external program.  It was written for three reasons.
#
# 1) To overcome the deficiency	of Lynx_386 not supporting ftp and news.
#    External programs can be used instead by passing the URL.
#
# 2) To allow for background	transfers in multitasking systems.
#    I use wget for http and ftp transfers via the external command.
#
# 3) To allow for new URLs to be used through Lynx.
#	  URLs can be made up such as mymail: to spawn desired applications
#	  via the external command.
#
# Restrictions can be imposed using -restrictions=externals at the Lynx
# command line.  This will disallow all EXTERNAL lines in lynx.cfg that
# end in FALSE.  TRUE lines will still function.
#
# The lynx.cfg line is as follows:
#
# EXTERNAL:<url>:<command> %s:<norestriction>
#
# <url> Any given URL.  This can be normal ones like ftp or http or it
# can be one made up like mymail.
#
# <command> The command to run with %s being the URL that will be passed.
# In Linux I use "wget -q %s &" (no quotes) to spawn a copy of wget for
# downloading http and ftp files in the background.  In Win95 I use
# "start ncftp %s" to spawn ncftp in a new window.
#
# <norestriction> This complements the -restrictions=externals feature to allow
# for certain externals to be enabled while restricting others.  TRUE means
# a command will still function while Lynx is restricted.  WB
#
# EXTERNAL:ftp:wget %s &:TRUE

# CERN-style rules, EXPERIMENTAL  -  URL-specific rules
#
# A CERN-style rules file can be given with RULESFILE.  Use the system's
# native format for filenames, on Unix '~' is also recognized.  If a filename
# is given, the file must exist.
#
# Single CERN-style rules can be specified with RULES.
#
# Both options can be repeated, rules accumulate in the order
# given, they will be applied in first-to-last order.  See cernrules.txt
# in the samples subdirectory for further explanation.
#
# Examples:
#	RULESFILE:/etc/lynx/cernrules
#	RULE:Fail	gopher:*		     # reject by scheme
#	RULE:Pass	finger://*@localhost/	     # allow this,
#	RULE:Fail	finger:*		     # but not others
#	RULE:Map	http://old.server/*	http://new.server/*


# Pretty source view settings. These settings are in effect when -prettysrc
# was specified.
# The following lexical elements (lexems) are recognised:
# comment, tag, attribute, attribute value, generalized angle brackets (
# '<' '>' '</' ), entity, hyperlink destination , entire file,bad sequence,
# bad tag, bad attribute, sgml special.
#  The following group of option tells which styles will surround each
# lexem. The syntax of option in this group is:
#HTMLSRC_<LEXEMNAME>:<TAGSPEC>:<TAGSPEC>
# The first <TAGSPEC> specifies what tags will precede lexems of that class
# in the internal html markup. The second - what will be placed (internally)
# after it.
# TAGSPEC has the following syntax:
# <TAGSPEC>:= [ (<TAGOPEN> | <TAGCLOSE>) <SPACE>+ ]*
# <TAGOPEN>:= tagname[.classname]
# <TAGCLOSE>:= !tagname
#
# The following table gives correspondence between lexem and lexem name

# bad tag                    BADTAG    Unrecognized contruct in generalized
#                                      brackets.
# bad attribute              BADATTR   The name of the attribute unknown to lynx
#                                      of the tag known to lynx. (ie
#                                      attributes of unknown tags will have
#                                      markup of  ATTRIB)
# sgml special               SGMLSPECIAL doctype, sgmlelt, sgmlele,
#                                      sgmlattlist, marked section, identifier
#
#                 Notes:
# 1) The markup for HTML_ENTIRE will be emitted only once - it will surround
# entire file source.
# 2) The tagnames specified by TAGPEC should be valid html tag names.
# 3) If the tag/class combination given by TAGOPEN is not assigned a color
#    style in lss file (for lynx compiled with lss support), that tag/class
#    combination will be anyway emitted during internal html markup. Such
#    combinations will be also reported to the trace log.
# 4) Lexeme 'tag' means everything contained in generalized angle brackets
# 5) Angle brackets of html specials won't be surrounded by markup for ABRACKET
#
#         Examples:
# HTMLSRC_COMM:B I:!I !B
#         - html comments will be surrounded by <b><i> and </i></b> in the
#           internal html markup
# HTMLSRC_ATTRVAL: span.attrval : !span
#         - values of the attributes will be surrounded by the
#           <SPAN class=attrval> </SPAN>
# HTMLSRC_HREF::
#         - no special html markup will surround hyperlink destinations (
#           this means that only default color style for hrefs will be applied
#           to them)
#
# For lynx compiled with lss support, the following settings are the default:
#HTMLSRC_COMM:span.htmlsrc_comment:!span
#HTMLSRC_TAG:span.htmlsrc_tag:!span
#HTMLSRC_ATTRIB:span.htmlsrc_attrib:!span
#HTMLSRC_ATTRVAL:span.htmlsrc_attrval:!span

#HTMLSRC_BADTAG:span.htmlsrc_badtag:!span
#HTMLSRC_BADATTR:span.htmlsrc_badattr:!span
#HTMLSRC_SGMLSPECIAL:span.htmlsrc_sgmlspecial:!span
# the styles corresponding to them are present in sample .lss file.
# For lynx compiled without lss support, the following settings are the default:
#HTMLSRC_COMM:b:!b
