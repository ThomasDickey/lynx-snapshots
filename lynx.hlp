1 LYNX
 NAME
 lynx - a general purpose distributed information browser for the World 
 Wide Web

2 SYNOPSIS
     Lynx [options] [path or URL]

     use "lynx -help" to display a complete list of current options.

2 DESCRIPTION
 Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
 cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100 terminals,
 vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other "curses-oriented"
 display). It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents con-
 taining links to files residing on the local system, as well as files
 residing on remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP
 servers.  Current versions of Lynx run on Unix and VMS.

 Lynx can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or to build
 information systems intended primarily for local access.  For example, Lynx
 has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
 addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

2 OPTIONS
 At start up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL specified at 
 the command line.  For help with URLs, press "?" or "h" while running
 Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."

  -
       If the argument is only '-', then Lynx expects to receive
       arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the potentially
       very long command line that can be associated with the
       -get_data or -post_data arguments (see below).  Encase it
       in double-quotes ("-").

  -anonymous
       used to specify the anonymous account.

  -assume_charset=MIMEname
       charset for documents that don't specify it.

  -assume_local_charset=MIMEname
       charset assumed for local files.

  -assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname
       use this instead of unrecognized charsets.

  -auth=ID:PASSWD
       set authorization ID and password for protected documents
       at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files which use
       this switch.

  -base
       prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html
       outputs for -source dumps.

  -blink
       forces high intensity bg colors for color mode, if available
       and supported by the terminal.
       Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.

  -book
       use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
       line startfile is still set for the Main screen command, and will
       be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

  -buried_news
       toggles scanning of news articles for buried references, and
       converts them to news links.  Not recommended because email
       addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to
       false news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.

  -cache=NUMBER
       set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.  The default is 10.

  -case
       enable case-sensitive string searching.

  -cfg=FILENAME
       specifies a Lynx configuration file other than the default lynx.cfg.

  -child
       exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk.

  -color
       forces color mode on, if available.  Default color control sequences
       which work for many terminal types are assumed if the terminal
       capability description does not specify how to handle color.
       Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.
       A saved show_color=always setting found in a .lynxrc file at
       startup has the same effect.  A saved show_color=always found
       in .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.

  -cookies
       toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

  -crawl
       with -traversal, output each page to a file.
       with -dump, format output as with -traversal, but to stdout.

  -display=DISPLAY
       set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.

  -dump
       dumps the formatted output of the default document or one specified
       on the command line to standard out.  This can be used in the
       following way:
           lynx -dump http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html

  -editor=EDITOR
       enable edit mode using the specified EDITOR. (vi, ed, emacs, etc.)

  -emacskeys
       enable emacs-like key movement.

  -enable_scrollback
       toggles compatibility with comm programs' scrollback keys
       (may be incompatible with some curses packages).

  -error_file=FILE
       define a file where Lynx will report HTTP access codes.

  -fileversions
       include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.

  -force_html
       forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.

  -force_secure
       toggles forcing of the secure flag for SSL cookies.

  -from
       toggles transmissions of From headers.

  -ftp 
       disable ftp access.

  -get_data
       send form data from stdin using GET method and dump results.

  -head
       send a HEAD request for the mime headers.

  -help
       print this Lynx command syntax usage message.

  -historical
       toggles use of '>' or '-->' as a terminator for comments.

  -homepage=URL
       set homepage separate from start page.

  -image_links
       toggles inclusion of links for all images.

  -index=URL
       set the default index file to the specified URL.

  -ismap
       toggles inclusion of ISMAP links when client-side
       MAPs are present.

  -link=NUMBER
       starting count for lnk#.dat files produced by -crawl.

  -localhost
       disable URLs that point to remote hosts.

  -locexec
       enable local program execution from local files only (if
       Lynx was compiled with local execution enabled).

  -mime_header
       prints the MIME header of a fetched document along with its
       source.

  -minimal
       toggles minimal versus valid comment parsing.

  -newschunksize=NUMBER
       number of articles in chunked news listings.

  -newsmaxchunk=NUMBER
       maximum news articles in listings before chunking.

  -nobrowse
       disable directory browsing.

  -nocc
       disable Cc: prompts for self copies of mailings.  Note
       that this does not disable any CCs which are incorporated
       within a mailto URL or form ACTION.

  -nocolor
       force color mode off, overriding terminal capabilities and any
       -color flags, COLORTERM variable, and saved .lynxrc settings.

2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
 Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way.
 The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Computing
 Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ
 in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of 
 Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx.
 Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
 developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of 
 Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
 and the WWW community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
 ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
 since the departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the
 University of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release
 of v2.7.2, and to everyone on the net who has contributed to Lynx's
 development either directly (through patches, comments or bug reports)
 or indirectly (through inspiration and development of other systems).
