 * or:
 *     lynxexec://<COMMAND>
 * or:
 *     lynxprog:<COMMAND>
 * or:
 *     lynxprog://<COMMAND>

 * where <COMMAND> is a command that Lynx will run when the link is
 * activated.  The double-slash should be included if the command begins
 * with an '@', as for executing VMS command files.  Otherwise, the double-
 * slash can be omitted.
 * Use lynxexec for commands or scripts that generate a screen output which
 * should be held via a prompt to press <return> before returning to Lynx
 * for display of the current document.
 * Use lynxprog for programs such as mail which do not require a pause before
 * Lynx restores the display of the current document.
 *
 * Execution scripts take the form of a standard
 * URL.  Extension mapping or MIME typing is used
 * to decide if the file is a script and should be
 * executed.  The current extensions are:
 * .csh, .ksh, and .sh on UNIX systems and .com on
 * VMS systems.  Any time a file of this type is
 * accessed Lynx will look at the user's options
 * settings to decide if the script can be executed.
 * Current options include: Only exec files that
 * reside on the local machine and are referenced
 * with a "file://localhost" URL, All execution
 * off, and all execution on.
 *
 * The following definitions will add execution
 * capabilities to Lynx.  You may define none, one
 * or both.
 *
 * I strongly recommend that you define neither one
 * of these since execution links/scripts can represent
 * very serious security risk to your system and its
 * users.  If you do define these I suggest that
 * you only allow users to execute files/scripts
 * that reside on your local machine.
 *
 * YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
