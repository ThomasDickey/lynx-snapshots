<h1>+++ Follow link (or goto link or page) number Help +++</h1>

If a user has set <em>Keypad mode</em> to <em>Links are numbered</em>
as the default or for the current session via the <em>Options menu</em>,
then hypertext links which have visible link names are prefixed with
numbers in square brackets.  Entering a keyboard or keypad number is
treated as an <em>F_LINK_NUM</em> command, and should invoke the
<em>Follow link (or goto link or page) number:</em> statusline prompt for
a potentially multiple digit number corresponding to an indicated link
number.  If RETURN is pressed to terminate the number entry (e.g.,
<em>123</em>), Lynx will retrieve the document for that link as if you
had paged or used other navigation commands to make it the current link
and then ACTIVATE-ed it.  The prompt can be invoked via <em>0</em>,
but it will not be treated as the lead digit for the number entry,
whereas <em>1</em> through <em>9</em> both invoke the prompt and are
treated as the first digit.

<p>If the number entered at the prompt has a '<em>g</em>' suffix (e.g.,
<em>123g</em>), then Lynx will make the link corresponding to that number
the current link, paging as appropriate if the link does not appear in
the currently displayed page.  Alternatively, if the number is given a
'<em>p</em>' suffix (e.g., <em>123p</em>), Lynx will make the page
corresponding to that number the currently displayed page, and the first
link on that page, if any, the current link.  The '<em>g</em>' and
'<em>p</em>' suffixes thus convert the 
<em>Follow link (or goto link or page) number:</em>
feature to an advanced navigation aid.

<p>If the user has set <em>Keypad mode</em> to <em>Numbers as arrows</em>,
then only '<em>0</em>', rather than every number, will be treated as an
<em>F_LINK_NUM</em> command for invoking the <em>Follow link (or goto link or page)
number:</em> prompt.  The '<em>0</em>' will not be treated as the first
digit for the number, or number plus suffix, entry.

<p>Note that HTML can be structured so that it includes <em>hidden
links</em>, i.e., without a visible link name intended for ACTIVATE-ing
the link.  Such links may be created, for example, by making an IMG element
the sole content of an Anchor element, and including an ALT="" attribute
name/value pair to suppress access to the link when the browser does not
have support for image handling available.  They also can be created by
having truly empty Anchor content, in cases for which the value of an
Anchor's HREF attribute is intended as a navigation aid for robots
(typically indexers) and not as content for a browser's rendition of the
document.  With the <em>-ismap</em> command line switch, Lynx will 
additionally treat a link to a server-side image maps as hidden if
there also is a client-side map for the same image.
Finally, in some cases links which are not intended to be hidden
may effectively become <em>hidden links</em> because of bad HTML.
The <em>hidden links</em> differ from Anchors which have only a
NAME or ID attribute name/value pair (intended as positioning targets from
other links which do have HREF attributes and values that include a
fragment).  

<p>Lynx respects instructions for <em>hidden links</em> and normally does
not include them in the rendition of the document.  However, if the command
line switch <em>-hiddenlinks=merge</em> is used, such links will still be
numbered in sequence with other links which are not hidden, and if <em>Links
are numbered</em> mode is also on, link numbers will appear for them in the
displayed text (except for links to image maps which are hidden because of 
<em>-ismap</em>).  If <em>-hiddenlinks=listonly</em> or
<em>-hiddenlinks=ignore</em> is in effect, <em>hidden links</em> will not be
shown in the text even in <em>links are numbered</em> mode.  Not using a
<em>-hiddenlinks</em> flag at all is equivalent to
<em>-hiddenlinks=listonly</em>.

<p>If a document includes
<em>hidden links</em>, they will be reported, with appropriate labeling,
in the menu created for the LIST ('<em>l</em>') command,
unless <em>-hiddenlinks=ignore</em> is used.  They can then be
ACTIVATE-ed via that menu.  Also, if a link was hidden due to an ALT
attribute in an IMG element, it will be converted to a <em>visible link</em>
whenever the IMAGE_TOGGLE ('<em>*</em>') command is used to create links
for SRC attritute values of IMG elements, because this indicates that the
user does have some form of image handling enabled via a helper application, 
or wishes to download files for subsequent use with a graphic browsers or
other suitable software.
