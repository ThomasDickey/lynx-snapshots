<h1><em>About Lynx</em></h1>

Lynx is a fully-featured <em>World Wide Web</em> (<em>WWW</em>) browser
for users on Unix, VMS, and other platforms running cursor-addressable,
character-cell terminals or emulators. That includes vt100 terminals,
other character-cell displays, and vt100 emulators such as Kermit or
Procomm running on PCs or Macs.

<P>For information on how to use Lynx see the
<A HREF="Lynx_users_guide.html">Lynx User's Guide</A>, or the
<A HREF="lynx_help_main.html">Lynx help files</A>.

<H2><EM>Credits and Copyright</EM></H2>

Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within
Academic Computing Services of <A
HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/">The University of Kansas</A>.

<P>Lynx was originally developed by
<A HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Lou.Montulli.html"
>Lou Montulli</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cc.ku.edu/~grobe/"
>Michael Grobe</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Charles.Rezac.html"
>Charles Rezac</A>.
<A HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Garrett/Garrett_Arch_Blythe.html"
>Garrett Blythe</A> created
<A HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_doslynx/doslynx.html">DosLynx</A>
and later joined the Lynx effort as well.  Following the departures of
Lou and Garrett for positions at Netscape in the summer of 1994,
<EM>Craig Lavender</EM> provided support services for Lynx, and
<EM>Ravikumar Kolli</EM> for DosLynx.

<P>Currently Lynx is being maintained and supported by members of the
Internet community coordinated via the
<A HREF="#lynx-dev_list"><EM>lynx-dev mailing list</EM></A>.

<P>Lynx is derived from material copyrighted by the University of Kansas.

<P>Lynx was built over an early version of the Common Code Library
developed by the CERN WWW Project.  That code is copyrighted by CERN.
Lynx contains other sections of code that are copyrighted
by other institutions or individuals.
The Lynx copyright does not override or invalidate those copyrights.

<P>Thanks to <A NAME="13" HREF="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/"
>Tim Berners-Lee</A> and the other <A NAME="14"
HREF="http://www.w3.org/People.html">CERN World Wide
Web wizards</A> for the WWW client library code and all of their other
work on the WWW project, NCSA and the
<A HREF="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html"
>Mosaic</A> developers, and to everyone out in netland who has
contributed to Lynx's development either directly (through comments
or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and development of
other systems).

<P>Also, special thanks go to <EM>Foteos Macrides</EM> who ported much of
Lynx to VMS and did much of it's development following Lou Montulli's
and Garrett Blythe's departures from the University of Kansas, and to
<EM>Earl Fogel</EM> of the University of Saskatchewan.  Earl implemented
the hypertext engine HYPERREZ in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was
developed by Niel Larson of Think.com and served as the model for
the early versions of Lynx which did not use the WWW libraries and
had their own hypertext format.
