  <h2>About Lynx</h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> is a fully-featured <em>World Wide
  Web</em> (<em>WWW</em>) browser for users on Unix, VMS, and other
  platforms running cursor-addressable, character-cell terminals or
  emulators. That includes vt100 terminals, other character-cell
  displays, and vt100 emulators such as Kermit or Procomm running
  on PCs or Macs.</p>

  <p>For information on how to use <strong>Lynx</strong> see the
  <a href="Lynx_users_guide.html">Lynx User's Guide</a>, or the
  <a href="lynx_help_main.html">Lynx help files</a>.</p>

  <h2>Credits and Copyright</h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> was a product of the Distributed
  Computing Group within Academic Computing Services of <a href=
  "http://web.archive.org/web/19971210163627/http://www.cc.ukans.edu/">
  The University of Kansas</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> was originally developed by <a href=

  DosLynx</a> and later joined the <strong>Lynx</strong> effort as
  well. Following the departures of Lou and Garrett for positions
  at Netscape in the summer of 1994, <em>Craig Lavender</em>
  provided support services for <strong>Lynx</strong>, and
  <em>Ravikumar Kolli</em> for DosLynx.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> is maintained and supported by members
  of the Internet community coordinated via the <a href=

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> is derived from material copyrighted by

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> was built over an early version of the
  Common Code Library developed by the CERN WWW Project. That code
  is copyrighted by CERN. <strong>Lynx</strong> contains other
  sections of code that are copyrighted by other institutions or
  individuals. The <strong>Lynx</strong> copyright does not
  override or invalidate those copyrights.</p>

  Berners-Lee</a> and the other <a name="note14" href=

  Mosaic</a> developers, and to everyone out in netland who has
  contributed to <strong>Lynx</strong>'s development either
  directly (through comments or bug reports) or indirectly (through
  inspiration and development of other systems).</p>

  <p>Also, special thanks go to <em>Foteos Macrides</em> who ported
  much of <strong>Lynx</strong> to VMS and did much of its
  development following Lou Montulli's and Garrett Blythe's
  departures from the University of Kansas, and to <em>Earl
  Fogel</em> of the University of Saskatchewan. Earl implemented
  the hypertext engine HYPERREZ in the Unix environment. HYPERREZ
  was developed by Niel Larson of Think.com and served as the model
  for the early versions of <strong>Lynx</strong> which did not use
  the WWW libraries and had their own hypertext format.</p>
