  <h1><em>About Lynx</em></h1>

  <p>Lynx is a fully-featured <em>World Wide Web</em>
  (<em>WWW</em>) browser for users on Unix, VMS, and other
  platforms running cursor-addressable, character-cell terminals or
  emulators. That includes vt100 terminals, other character-cell
  displays, and vt100 emulators such as Kermit or Procomm running
  on PCs or Macs.</p>

  <p>For information on how to use Lynx see the <a href=
  "Lynx_users_guide.html">Lynx User's Guide</a>, or the <a href=
  "lynx_help_main.html">Lynx help files</a>.</p>

  <h2><em>Credits and Copyright</em></h2>

  <p>Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within
  Academic Computing Services of <a href=
  "http://www.cc.ukans.edu/">The University of Kansas</a>.</p>

  <p>Lynx was originally developed by <a href=
  "http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Lou.Montulli.html">Lou
  Montulli</a>, <a href="http://www.cc.ku.edu/~grobe/">Michael
  Grobe</a>, and <a href=
  "http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Charles.Rezac.html">Charles
  Rezac</a>. <a href=
  "http://www.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/people/Garrett/Garrett_Arch_Blythe.html">
  Garrett Blythe</a> created <a href=
  "http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_doslynx/doslynx.html">DosLynx</a>
  and later joined the Lynx effort as well. Following the
  departures of Lou and Garrett for positions at Netscape in the
  summer of 1994, <em>Craig Lavender</em> provided support services
  for Lynx, and <em>Ravikumar Kolli</em> for DosLynx.</p>

  <p>Lynx is maintained and supported by members of the Internet
  community coordinated via the <a href=
  "#lynx-dev_list"><em>lynx-dev mailing list</em></a>.</p>

  <p>Lynx is derived from material copyrighted by the University of
  Kansas. However most of the release (and corresponding copyright)
  is the work of developers on the <a href=
  "#lynx-dev_list"><em>lynx-dev mailing list</em></a>. It is
  distributed <a href="COPYHEADER">without restrictions on usage or
  redistribution</a> under the <a href="COPYING">GNU General Public
  License (Version 2)</a>.</p>

  <p>Lynx was built over an early version of the Common Code
  Library developed by the CERN WWW Project. That code is
  copyrighted by CERN. Lynx contains other sections of code that
  are copyrighted by other institutions or individuals. The Lynx
  copyright does not override or invalidate those copyrights.</p>

  <p>Thanks to <a name="13" href=
  "http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> and
  the other <a name="14" href="http://www.w3.org/People.html">CERN
  World Wide Web wizards</a> for the WWW client library code and
  all of their other work on the WWW project, NCSA and the <a href=
  "http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">
  Mosaic</a> developers, and to everyone out in netland who has
  contributed to Lynx's development either directly (through
  comments or bug reports) or indirectly (through inspiration and
  development of other systems).</p>

  <p>Also, special thanks go to <em>Foteos Macrides</em> who ported
  much of Lynx to VMS and did much of its development following Lou
  Montulli's and Garrett Blythe's departures from the University of
  Kansas, and to <em>Earl Fogel</em> of the University of
  Saskatchewan. Earl implemented the hypertext engine HYPERREZ in
  the Unix environment. HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of
  Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx
  which did not use the WWW libraries and had their own hypertext
  format.</p>
