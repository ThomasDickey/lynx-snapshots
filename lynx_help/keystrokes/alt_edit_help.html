<h1>+++ALTERNATIVE BINDING+++</h1>

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Administrators can offer additional alternative key
bindings by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in
LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx.  If available,
they may be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in
the '.lynxrc' file.

<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no direct effect on line-editor bindings.

<p>This is the <em>Alternative Binding</em> keymap:

     cursor.

[2]  Follow Ctrl-V with the key "e" bound to the DWIMEDIT function,
     or with some other key bound to EDITTEXTAREA or DWIMEDIT,
     to edit the form's textarea field using an external editor.
