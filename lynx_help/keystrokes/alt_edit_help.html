<h1>+++ALTERNATIVE BINDING+++</h1>

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Additional alternative key-bindings can be offered
by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in
LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx.  If available,
they may be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in
the '.lynxrc' file.

<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no direct effect on line-editor bindings.

<p>This is the <em>Alternative Binding</em> keymap:
