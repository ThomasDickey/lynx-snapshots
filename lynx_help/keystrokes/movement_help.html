                          above the current one, and there are
                          previous pages to move to.

        *note: If 'VI Keys' are enabled from the options menu or
               from the '.lynxrc' file, lowercase h,j,k,l will
               move left, down, up, and right, respectively.

        *note: If 'Emacs Keys' are enabled from the options menu or
               from the '.lynxrc' file, Ctrl-B, Ctrl-N, Ctrl-P,

               translate the numbers of your keypad into movement
               commands.  The translation is as follows.
