  <h1>Visited Links Page Help</h1>

  <p>The Visited Links Page displays all of the links that you have
  traveled through during the current Lynx session, except for any
  temporary menu or list files, bookmark files, or any documents
  associated with POST content. The VLINKS keystroke command for
  invoking this page normally is mapped to uppercase '<em>V</em>'.
  The list of Visited Links is normally in order of recency (most
  recently visited links first), without repetitions in the list if
  a link was visited more than once during the session (unless the
  URLs differ due to appended fragments), and is supplementary to
  the <a href="history_help.html">History Page</a>.</p>

  <p>You may <a href="movement_help.html">select</a> any link on
  the Visited Links Page to retrieve a document that you had
  previously visited, or you can use this list to save such links
  in your <a href="bookmark_help.html">bookmark files</a>, or to
  <a href="../Lynx_users_guide.html#RemoteSource">Download</a>
  them.</p>

  <p>In contrast to the History Page, the Visited Links Page
  includes any links which were retrieved for
  '<em>d</em>'ownloading or were passed to helper applications,
  i.e., not just the links that were rendered and displayed by
  Lynx, itself.</p>

  <p>You may change the appearance of the Visited Links Page via a
  popup menu on that page (which also appears on the <a href=
  "option_help.html#VP">Options Menu</a>).</p>
