  <h2>X Terminal Help</h2>

  <p>An X terminal is an electronic display terminal that
  communicates with a host computer system using the X Window
  protocol developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology.</p>

  <p>The X Window protocol allows a program running on the host
  computer system to display both formatted text and graphics on
  the X terminal. Since the X Window protocol is defined to work
  over any TCP/IP network, X terminals connected to the Internet
  can be connected to hosts located anywhere on the Internet.</p>

  <p>Personal computers (including both PCs and Macintoshes) can
  execute programs, usually called X servers, that make them act
  like X Window terminals and are frequently used as X
  terminals.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Terminology</dt>

    <dd>The terminology used to describe processes associated with
    X terminals can be confusing. An X terminal is also known as an
    "X display server," and the program running on the host
    computer is usually known as the "X client."</dd>
