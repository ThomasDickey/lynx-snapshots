<h1>+++DEFAULT BINDING+++</h1>

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Administrators can offer alternate key bindings
by adding them in LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx.  If available, they may 
be selected via the old-style 'o'ptions menu (see -forms_options command 
line option), or by editing lineedit_mode in the .lynxrc file. 
 
<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no effect on line-editor bindings. 
 
<p>This is the <em>Default Binding</em>:
