  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em>
  for entering strings in response to prompts, in forms, and for
  email messages if an external editor has not been defined.
  Alternative key bindings are normally available (unless
  <strong>Lynx</strong> was configured with
  <code>--disable-alt-bindings</code>). If available, they may be
  selected via the &ldquo;o&rdquo;ptions menu, or by editing
  lineedit_mode in the &ldquo;.lynxrc&rdquo; file.</p>

  <p>Two such alternative key bindings, which may be available on
  your system, are the</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="alt_edit_help.html">Alternative Binding</a> keymap
    and the</li>

    <li><a href="bashlike_edit_help.html">Bash-like Binding</a>
    keymap.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can always see the current set of key-bindings in
  <strong>Lynx</strong> by opening the special URL <a href=
  "LYNXEDITMAP:">LYNXEDITMAP:</a>. This page is provided for those
  not using Lynx.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> setting emacs/vi keys ON has
  no effect on line-editor bindings.</p>

  <h2><a name="regular_keymap" id="regular_keymap">Regular

  <p>Here is a little textarea for practice:</p>

  <form action="">

    <textarea name="practice" cols="40" rows="5">
This text cannot be submitted.  Normally lines like
these would be part of a form that is filled out and
then submitted.  You can move around here and delete
or add text as you like, using the Line-Editor keys.

  </form>

  <h2><a name="special_keys" id="special_keys">Special
  keys</a></h2>

  <p><samp><dfn>Ctrl-</dfn><strong>key</strong> means
  Control+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
  <dfn><code>Ctrl-x</code></dfn> <strong>key</strong> means first
  Control+<kbd>x</kbd>, then <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
  <dfn>M-</dfn>key means Meta+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>,
  where Meta is a modifier that can be entered in a variety of
  ways:</samp></p>

  <ul>
    <li>First ESC, then the <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>. This
    does not work with all systems or on all connections, and if it
    does may not work for some keys (because the ESC character is
    also part of code sequences for "normal" function keys).</li>

    <li>Alt+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>. This works if the
    terminal, console, or comm program is set up to interpret Alt
    as a modifier to send ESC. The Linux console acts like that by
    default for most keys; Kermit can be set up to do it, xterm can
    be for some keys, and so on. But the same caveats as for the
    previous item apply. This Alt mapping may also be possible,
    independent of the ESC character, for some keys in
    <strong>Lynx</strong> for DOS/i386 or for Win32.</li>

    <li>Ctrl-x <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>. Actually, currently
    the same internal table is used for Meta and the Ctrl-x prefix.
    Therefore all M-<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong> combinations
    can also be typed as Ctrl-x <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>,
    and vice versa.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A few key names may be less familiar now than when
  <strong>Lynx</strong> was first written: <em>Find</em>,
  <em>Select</em> and <em>Remove</em>. The <a href=
  "https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.faq.html#xterm_keypad">XTerm
  FAQ</a> shows some typical keypad layouts of emulators for VT220
  and other DEC terminals.</p>

  <p>The VT220 did not have a &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; key but
  <strong>Lynx</strong>'s default bindings mention it. Both ASCII
  <samp>BS</samp> (backspace) and <samp>DEL</samp> are bound by
  default to the same functions. <samp>DEL</samp> (occasionally
  referred to as <samp>RUBOUT</samp>) is not the same as
  <samp>Delete</samp>: the former is a single character while the
  latter is usually a sequence of characters.</p>

  <h2><a name="notes" id="notes">Notes</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li id="note_1">"next" means the character "under" a box or
    underline style cursor; it means "to the immediate right of" an
    I-beam (between characters) type cursor.</li>

    <li id="note_2">Follow Ctrl-V with any recognized key command,
    to "escape" from a text input field.</li>

    prefix key, see the Help page for the <a rel="Sibling" title=
