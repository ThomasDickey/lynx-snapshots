  <h1>DEFAULT BINDING</h1>

  <p>Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering
  strings in response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages
  if an external editor has not been defined. Alternative key
  bindings are normally available (unless Lynx was configured with
  <code>--disable-alt-bindings</code>). If available, they may be
  selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in
  the '.lynxrc' file.</p>

  <p>Two such alternative key bindings, which may be available on
  your system, are the <a href="alt_edit_help.html">Alternative
  Binding</a> keymap and the <a href=
  "bashlike_edit_help.html">Bash-like Binding</a> keymap.</p>

  <p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no effect on line-editor
  bindings.</p>

  <p>This is the <em>Default Binding</em> keymap:</p>
  <pre>
     ENTER  Input complete        -  RETURN
     TAB    Input complete        -  TAB, Do

     means "to the immediate right of" an I-beam (between characters) type
     cursor.

     input field.
