  <h1>DEFAULT BINDING</h1>

  <p>Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering
  strings in response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages
  if an external editor has not been defined. Alternative key
  bindings can be offered by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings
  or by adding them in LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx. If
  available, they may be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by
  editing lineedit_mode in the '.lynxrc' file.</p>

  <p>Two such alternative key bindings, which may be available on
  your system, are the <a href="alt_edit_help.html">Alternative
  Binding</a> keymap and the <a href=
  "bashlike_edit_help.html">Bash-like Binding</a> keymap.</p>

  <p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no effect on line-editor
  bindings.</p>

  <p>This is the <em>Default Binding</em> keymap:</p>
