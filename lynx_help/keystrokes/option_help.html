<h1>+++ Options Screen Help +++</h1>
<PRE>
        The Options Screen allows you to set and
        modify many of Lynx's features. The following
        options may be set.

     Editor             -  If non-empty it defines the editor to spawn
                           when editing a local file or sending mail.
			   Any valid text editor may be entered here.

     DISPLAY variable   -  If non-empty it specifies your <A HREF="xterm_help.html">X terminal</A>
                           display address.

     Multi-bookmarks    -  When OFF, the default bookmark file is used
                           for the 'v'iew bookmarks and 'a'dd bookmark
                           link commands.  If set to STANDARD, a menu
                           of available bookmarks always is invoked
                           when you seek to view a bookmark file or add
                           a link, and you select the bookmark file by
                           its letter token in that menu.  If set to
                           ADVANCED, you instead are prompted for the
                           letter of the desired bookmark file, but can
                           enter '=' to invoke the STANDARD selection
                           menu, or RETURN for the default bookmark file.

     Bookmark file      -  If non-empty and multi-bookmarks is OFF, it
                           specifies your default '<A HREF="bookmark_help.html">Bookmark file</A>'.
                           If multi-bookmarks is STANDARD or ADVANCED,
                           entering 'B' will invoke a menu in which you
                           can specify the filepaths and descriptions
                           of up to 26 bookmark files.  The filepaths
                           must be from your home directory, and begin
                           with dot-slash (./) if subdirectories are
                           included (e.g, ./BM/lynx_bookmarks.html).
                           Lynx will create bookmark files when you
                           first 'a'dd a link, but any subdirectories
                           in the filepath must already exist.

     FTP sort criteria  -  This option allows you to specify how files
                           will be sorted within FTP listings.  The
                           current options include "By Filename",
                           "By Size", "By Type", and "By Date".

     Personal Mail      -  You may set your mail address here so that
     Address               when mailing messages to other people or
                           mailing files to yourself, your email address
                           can be automatically filled in.  Your email
                           address will also be sent to HTTP servers in
                           a from: field.

     Searching type     -  If set to 'case sensitive', user searches
                           invoked by the '/' command will be case 
                           sensitive substring searches.  The
                           default is 'Case Insensitive' substring
                           searches

     Preferred Document -  The language you prefer if multi-language files
     Language              are available from servers.  Use RFC 1766 tags,
                           e.g., en for English, fr for French, etc.  Can be
                           a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted
			   by servers as descending order of preferences.
			   You can also make your order of preference explicit
			   by using q factors as defined by the HTTP protocol,
			   for servers which understand it, for example:
				<kbd>da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7</kbd>

     Preferred Document -  The character set you prefer if sets in addition
     Charset               to ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII are available from
                           servers.  Use MIME notation (e.g., ISO-8859-2)
                           and do not include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since
                           those values are always assumed by default.  Can
                           be a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted
			   by servers as descending order of preferences.
			   You can also make your order of preference explicit
			   by using q factors as defined by the HTTP protocol,
			   for servers which understand it, for example:
				<kbd>iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8</kbd>

     Display Character  -  This option allows you to set up the default
     set                   character set for your specific terminal.
                           The character set provides a mapping of 8-bit ISO
                           Latin character entities and/or Asian (CJK) or
                           Unicode characters into viewable characters and
                           should be set according to your terminal's
                           character set if you will be viewing such
                           characters with Lynx.  You must have the selected
                           character set installed on your terminal.

     Raw 8-bit or CJK   -  Toggles whether 8-bit characters are assumed to
     mode                  correspond with the selected character set and
                           therefore are processed without translation via
                           the chartrans conversion tables.  Should be ON
                           by default when the selected character set is one
                           of the Asian (CJK) sets and the 8-bit characters
                           are Kanji multibytes.  Should be OFF for the other
                           character sets, but can be turned ON when the
                           document's charset is unknown (e.g., is not
                           ISO-8859-1 and no charset parameter was included in
                           a reply header from an HTTP server to indicate what
                           it is) but you know by some means that you have the
                           matching display character set selected.  Should be
                           OFF when an Asian (CJK) set is selected but the
                           document is ISO-8859-1.  The setting also can be
                           toggled via the RAW_TOGGLE command, normally mapped
                           to '@', and at startup via the -raw switch.

     Show color        -   This option will be present if color support is
                           available.  If set to ON or ALWAYS, color mode will
                           be forced on if possible.  If (n)curses color
                           support is available but cannot be used for the
                           current terminal type, selecting ON is rejected
                           with a message.  If set to OFF or NEVER, color mode
                           will be turned off.
                           ALWAYS and NEVER are not offered in anonymous
                           accounts.  If saved to a '.lynxrc' file in
                           non-anonymous accounts, ALWAYS will cause Lynx to
                           set color mode on at startup if supported.  If Lynx
                           is built with the slang library, this is equivalent
                           to having included the -color command line switch
                           or having the COLORTERM environment variable
                           set. If color support is provided by curses or
                           ncurses, this is equivalent to the default behavior
                           of using color when the terminal type supports it.
                           If (n)curses color support is available but cannot
                           be used for the current terminal type, the
                           preference can still be saved but will have no
                           effect.
                           A saved value of NEVER will cause Lynx to assume a
                           monochrome terminal at startup.  It is similar to
                           the -nocolor switch, but (when the slang library is
                           used) can be overridden with the -color switch.
                           If the setting is OFF or ON when the current
                           options are saved to a '.lynxrc' file, the default
                           startup behavior is retained, such that color mode
                           will be turned on at startup only if the terminal
                           info indicates that you have a color-capable
                           terminal, or (when the slang library is used) if
                           forced on via the -color switch or COLORTERM
                           variable.  This default behavior always is used in
                           anonymous accounts, or if the 'option'_save
                           restriction is set explicitly.  If for any reason
                           the startup color mode is incorrect for your
                           terminal, set it appropriately on or off via this
                           option.

     VI keys           -   If set to 'ON' then the lowercase h, j, k, and l,
                           keys will be mapped to left-arrow, down-arrow,
			   up-arrow, and right-arrow, respectively.  The
                           uppercase H, J, K, and L keys remain mapped to
                           their configured bindings (normally HELP, JUMP,
                           KEYMAP, and LIST, respectively).

     Emacs keys        -   If set to 'ON' then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F, 
                           and CTRL-B keys will be mapped to up-arrow,
                           down-arrow, right-arrow,  and left-arrow,
                           respectively.  Otherwise, they remain mapped
                           to their configured bindings (normally UP_TWO
                           lines, DOWN_TWO lines, NEXT_PAGE, and PREV_PAGE,
                           respectively).

     Show dot files    -   If display/creation of hidden (dot)
                           files/directories is enabled, you can turn
                           the feature on or off via this setting.

     Popups for select -   Lynx normally uses a popup window for the
     fields                OPTIONs in form SELECT fields when the field
                           does not have the MULTIPLE attribute specified,
                           and thus only one OPTION can be selected.  The
                           use of popup windows can be disabled by changing
                           this setting to OFF, in which case the OPTIONs
                           will be rendered as a list of radio buttons.
                           Note that if the SELECT field does have the
                           MULTIPLE attribute specified, the OPTIONs always
                           are rendered as a list of checkboxes.

     Show cursor for   -   Lynx normally hides the cursor by positioning it
     current link or       to the right and if possible the very bottom of
     option                the screen, so that the current link or OPTION
                           is indicated solely by its highlighting or color.
                           If show cursor is set to ON, the cursor will be
	                   positioned at the left of the current link or
                           OPTION.  This is helpful when Lynx is being used
                           with a speech or braille interface.  It also is
                           useful for sighted users when the terminal cannot
                           distinguish the character attributes used to
                           distinguish the current link or OPTION from the
                           others in the screen display.

     Keypad mode       -   This option gives the choice between navigating 
                           with the keypad (as arrows; see Lynx Navigation)
                           and having every link numbered (numbered links)
			   so that the links may be selected by numbers
			   instead of moving to them with the arrow keys.

     Line edit style   -   This option allows you to set alternate key
                           bindings for the built-in line editor, if your
                           system administrator has installed alternates.
                           Otherwise, Lynx uses the <A HREF="edit_help.html">Default Binding</A>.

     List directory    -   Applies to Directory Editing.  Files and
     style                 directories can be presented in the following
                           ways:
                            Mixed style
                              Files and directories are listed together in
                              alphabetical order.
                            Directories first
                              Files and directories are separated into two
                              alphabetical lists.  Directories are listed
                              first.
                            Files first
                              Files and directories are separated into two
                              alphabetical lists.  Files are listed first.

     User Mode         -   Beginner 
                              Shows two extra lines of help at the bottom 
                              of the screen
                           Intermediate (normal mode) 
                              The "normal" statusline messages appear. 
                           Advanced 
                              The URL is shown on the statusline. 

      User Agent       -   The header string which Lynx sends to servers
                           to indicate the User-Agent is displayed here.
                           Changes may be disallowed via the -restrictions
                           switch.  Otherwise, the header can be changed
                           temporarily to a string such as L_y_n_x/2.7.2 for
                           access to sites which discriminate against Lynx
                           based on checks for the presence of "Lynx" in the
                           header. If changed during a Lynx session, the
                           default User-Agent header can be restored by
                           deleting the modified string in the Options Menu.
                           Whenever the User-Agent header is changed, the
                           current document is reloaded, with the no-cache
                           flags set, on exit from the Options Menu.  Changes
                           of the header are not saved in the RC file.
                           NOTE that Netscape Communications Corp. has
                           claimed that false transmissions of "Mozilla" as
                           the User-Agent are a copyright infringement, which
                           will be prosecuted.  DO NOT misrepresent Lynx as
                           Mozilla.  The Options Menu issues a warning about
                           possible copyright infringement whenever the header
                           is changed to one which does not include "Lynx" or
                           "lynx".

     Local execution   -   If set to 'ALWAYS ON', Lynx will locally execute
     links                 commands contained inside of any links.  This
                           can be HIGHLY DANGEROUS so it is recommended
                           that they remain 'ALWAYS OFF' or 'FOR LOCAL
                           FILES ONLY' unless otherwise set by your system
                           administrator.  This option may not be available
                           on most versions of Lynx.
