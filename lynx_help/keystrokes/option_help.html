  </ul>

  <h1><a name="CK">Cookies</a></h1>

  <p>This can be set to accept or reject all cookies or to ask each
  time. See the Users Guide for details of <a href=
  "../Lynx_users_guide.html#Cookies">cookie usage</a>.</p>

  <h1><a name="ED">Editor</a></h1>

  <p>This is the editor to be invoked when editing browsable files,
  sending mail or comments, or filling form's textarea (multiline
  input field). The full pathname of the editor command should be
  specified when possible. It is assumed the text editor supports
  the same character set you have for "display character set" in
  Lynx.</p>

  <h1><a name="EM">Emacs keys</a></h1>

  <p>If set to 'ON' then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F and CTRL-B keys
  will be mapped to up-arrow, down-arrow, right-arrow and
  left-arrow respectively. Otherwise, they remain mapped to their
  configured bindings (normally UP_TWO lines, DOWN_TWO lines,
  NEXT_PAGE and PREV_PAGE respectively).</p>

  <p>Note: setting emacs keys does not affect the line-editor
  bindings.</p>

  <h1><a name="LL">Execution links</a></h1>

  <p>If set to 'ALWAYS ON', Lynx will locally execute commands
  contained inside any links. This can be HIGHLY DANGEROUS, so it
  is recommended that they remain 'ALWAYS OFF' or 'FOR LOCAL FILES
  ONLY'.</p>

  <h1><a name="KM">Keypad mode</a></h1>

  <p>This gives the choice between navigating with the keypad (as
  arrows; see Lynx Navigation) and having every link numbered
  (numbered links) so that the links may be selected by numbers
  instead of moving to them with the arrow keys. You can also
  number form fields.</p>

  <h1><a name="LE">Line edit style</a></h1>

  <p>This allows you to set alternate key bindings for the built-in
  line editor, if <a href="alt_edit_help.html">Alternate
  Bindings</a> have been installed. Otherwise, Lynx uses the
  <a href="edit_help.html">Default Binding</a>.</p>

  <h1><a name="PM">Personal Mail Address</a></h1>

  <p>You may set your mail address here so that when mailing
  messages to other people or mailing files to yourself, your email
  address can be automatically filled in. Your email address will
  also be sent to HTTP servers in a `from:' field.</p>

  <h1><a name="PU">Pop-ups for select fields</a></h1>

  <p>Lynx normally uses a pop-up window for the OPTIONs in form
  SELECT fields when the field does not have the MULTIPLE attribute
  specified, and thus only one OPTION can be selected. The use of
  pop-up windows can be disabled by changing this setting to OFF,
  in which case the OPTIONs will be rendered as a list of radio
  buttons. Note that if the SELECT field does have the MULTIPLE
  attribute specified, the OPTIONs always are rendered as a list of
  checkboxes.</p>

  <h1><a name="ST">Searching type</a></h1>

  <p>If set to 'case sensitive', user searches invoked by '/' will
  be case-sensitive substring searches. Default is 'Case
  Insensitive'.</p>

  <h1><a name="SC">Show color</a></h1>

  <p>This will be present if color support is available.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If set to ON or ALWAYS, color mode will be forced on if
    possible. If (n)curses color support is available but cannot be
    used for the current terminal type, selecting ON is rejected
    with a message.</li>

    <li>If set to OFF or NEVER, color mode will be turned off.</li>

    <li>ALWAYS and NEVER are not offered in anonymous accounts. If
    saved to a '.lynxrc' file in non-anonymous accounts, ALWAYS
    will cause Lynx to set color mode on at startup if
    supported.</li>
  </ul>If Lynx is built with slang, this is equivalent to having
  included the -color command line switch or having the COLORTERM
  environment variable set. If color support is provided by curses
  or ncurses, this is equivalent to the default behavior of using
  color when the terminal type supports it. If (n)curses color
  support is available but cannot be used for the current terminal
  type, the preference can still be saved but will have no effect.

  <p>A saved value of NEVER will cause Lynx to assume a monochrome
  terminal at start-up. It is similar to the -nocolor switch, but
  (when the slang library is used) can be overridden with the
  -color switch. If the setting is OFF or ON when the current
  options are saved to a '.lynxrc' file, the default start-up
  behavior is retained, such that color mode will be turned on at
  startup only if the terminal info indicates that you have a
  color-capable terminal, or (when slang is used) if forced on via
  the -color switch or COLORTERM variable. This default behavior
  always is used in anonymous accounts, or if the 'option'_save
  restriction is set explicitly. If for any reason the start-up
  color mode is incorrect for your terminal, set it appropriately
  on or off via this option.</p>

  <h1><a name="CL">Show cursor for current link or option</a></h1>

  <p>Lynx normally hides the cursor by positioning it to the right
  and if possible the very bottom of the screen, so that the
  current link or OPTION is indicated solely by its highlighting or
  color. If show cursor is set to ON, the cursor will be positioned
  at the left of the current link or OPTION. This is helpful when
  Lynx is being used with a speech or braille interface. It is also
  useful for sighted users when the terminal cannot distinguish the
  character attributes used to distinguish the current link or
  OPTION from the others in the display.</p>

  <h1><a name="UM">User Mode</a></h1>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Novice</em>: Shows 2 extra lines of help at the bottom
    of the screen for beginners.</dt>

    <dt><em>Intermediate (normal)</em>: Normal status-line messages
    appear.</dt>

    <dt><em>Advanced</em>: The URL is shown on the status
    line.</dt>
  </dl>

  <h1><a name="AD">Assumed document character set</a></h1>

  <p>This changes the handling of documents which do not explicitly
  specify a charset. Normally Lynx assumes that 8-bit characters in
  those documents are encoded according to iso-8859-1 (the official
  default for HTTP protocol). Unfortunately, many non-English web
  pages forget to include proper charset info; this option helps
  you browse those broken pages if you know somehow what the
  charset is. When the value given here or by an -assume_charset
  command-line flag is in effect, Lynx will treat documents as if
  they were encoded accordingly. Option is active when 'Raw 8-bit
  or CJK Mode' is OFF.</p>

  <h1><a name="JK">Raw 8-bit or CJK mode</a></h1>

  <p>This is set automatically, but can be toggled manually in
  certain cases: it toggles whether 8-bit characters are assumed to
  correspond with the display character set and therefore are
  processed without translation via the chartrans conversion
  tables. ON by default when the display character set is one of
  the Asian (CJK) sets and the 8-bit characters are Kanji
  multibytes. OFF for the other display character sets, but can be
  turned ON when the document's charset is unknown (e.g., is not
  ISO-8859-1 and no charset parameter was specified in a reply
  header from an HTTP server to indicate what it is), but you have
  no better idea than viewing it as from display character set (see
  'assumed document character set' for best choice). Should be OFF
  when an Asian (CJK) set is selected but the document is
  ISO-8859-1 or another 'assumed document character set'. The
  setting can also be toggled via the RAW_TOGGLE command, normally
  mapped to '@', and at startup via the -raw switch.</p>

  <h1><a name="tagsoup">HTML error recovery</a></h1>

  <p>Lynx often has to deal with invalid HTML markup. It always
  tries to recover from errors, but there is no universally correct
  way for doing this. As a result, there are two parsing modes:
  "<dfn>SortaSGML</dfn>" attempts to enforce valid nesting of most
  tags at an earlier stage of processing, while
  "<dfn>TagSoup</dfn>" relies more on the HTML rendering stage to
  mimic the behavior of some other browsers. You can also switch
  between these modes with the CTRL-V key, and the default can be
  changed in lynx.cfg or with the -tagsoup command line switch.</p>

  <p>The "SortaSGML" mode will often appear to be more strict, and
  makes some errors apparent that are otherwise unnoticeable. One
  particular difference is the handling of block elements or
  &lt;li&gt;..&lt;/li&gt; inside &lt;a
  HREF="some.url"&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;. Invalid nesting like this may
  turn anchors into hidden links which cannot be easily followed,
  this is avoided in "TagSoup" mode. See the <a href=
  "follow_help.html">help on following links by number</a> for more
  information on hidden links. Often pages may be more readable in
  "TagSoup" mode, but sometimes the opposite is true. Most
  documents with valid HTML, and documents with only minor errors,
  should be rendered the same way in both modes.</p>

  <p>If you are curious about what goes on behind the scenes, but
  find that the information from the -trace switch is just too
  much, Lynx can be started with the -preparsed switch; going into
  SOURCE mode ('\' key) and toggling the parsing mode (with CTRL-V)
  should then show some of the differences. <!--
LP's version - for reference - TD

While the proper HTML markup should be canonical, badly nested HTML pages
may be recovered in different ways.  There are two error recovery modes
in Lynx: SortaSGML with the recovery at SGML stage and TagSoup mode
with the recovery at HTML parsing stage, the latter gives more
recovery and was the default in Lynx 2.7.2 and before,
and the first may be useful for page validation purposes.
One particular difference is known for &lt;li&gt;..&lt;/li&gt;
or similar strong markup inside &lt;a HREF="some.url"&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;
anchor text - those links are not reachable in SortaSGML
(such markup should be placed outside &lt;a&gt;..&lt;/a&gt; indeed).
Default recovery mode can also be switched with CTRL-V key,
from lynx.cfg or command line switch.

  <h1><a name="SI">Show Images</a></h1>

  <p>This option combines the effects of the `*' &amp; `[' keys as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
     <em>ignore</em> all images which lack an ALT= text string,
     <em>show labels</em>, e.g. [INLINE] &mdash; see `Verbose Images' below &mdash; ,
     <em>use links</em> for every image, enabling downloading.
</pre>

  <p>This option setting cannot be saved between sessions. See
  <a href="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Images">Users Guide</a> &amp;
  <em>lynx.cfg</em> for more details.</p>

  <h1><a name="VB">Verbose Images</a></h1>

  <p>This allows you to replace [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE] &mdash; for
  images without ALT &mdash; with filenames: this can be helpful by
  revealing which images are important &amp; which are merely
  decoration, e.g. <em>button.gif</em>, <em>line.gif</em>. See
  <a href="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Images">Users Guide</a> &amp;
  <em>lynx.cfg</em> for more details.</p>

  <h1><a name="VI">VI keys</a></h1>

  <p>If set to 'ON' then the lowercase h, j, k and l keys will be
  mapped to left-arrow, down-arrow, up-arrow and right-arrow
  respectively.</p>

  <p>The uppercase H, J, K, and L keys remain mapped to their
  configured bindings (normally HELP, JUMP, KEYMAP and LIST,
  respectively).</p>

  <p>Note: setting vi keys does not affect the line-editor
  bindings.</p>

  <h1><a name="DC">Display Character set</a></h1>

  <p>This allows you to set up the default character set for your
  specific terminal. The display character set provides a mapping
  from the character encodings of viewed documents and from HTML
  entities into viewable characters. It should be set according to
  your terminal's character set so that characters other than 7-bit
  ASCII can be displayed correctly, using approximations if
  necessary, <a href="test_display.html">try the test here</a>.
  Since Lynx now supports a wide range of platforms it may be
  useful to note that cpXXX codepages are used within IBM PC
  computers, and windows-xxxx within native MS-Windows
  applications.</p>

  <h1><a name="DV">X DISPLAY variable</a></h1>

  <p>This option is only relevant to X Window users. It specifies
  the DISPLAY (Unix) or DECW$DISPLAY (VMS) variable. It is picked
  up automatically from the environment if it has been previously
  set.</p>

  <h1><a name="MB">Multi-bookmarks</a></h1>

  <p>Manage multiple bookmark files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When OFF, the default bookmark file is used for the
    'v'iew-bookmarks and 'a'dd-bookmark link commands.</li>

    <li>If set to STANDARD, a menu of available bookmarks is always
    invoked when you seek to view a bookmark file or add a link,
    and you select the bookmark file by its letter token in that
    menu.</li>

    <li>If set to ADVANCED, you are instead prompted for the letter
    of the desired bookmark file, but can enter '=' to invoke the
    STANDARD selection menu, or RETURN for the default bookmark
    file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><a name="BF">Bookmark file</a></h1>

  <p>Manage the default bookmark file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If non-empty and multi-bookmarks is OFF, it specifies your
    default '<a href="bookmark_help.html">Bookmark file</a>'.</li>

    <li>If multi-bookmarks is STANDARD or ADVANCED, entering 'B'
    will invoke a menu in which you can specify filepaths and
    descriptions of up to 26 bookmark files.</li>
  </ul>The filepaths must be from your home directory and begin
  with './' if subdirectories are included (e.g.,
  './BM/lynx_bookmarks.html').

  <p>Lynx will create bookmark files when you first 'a'dd a link,
  but any subdirectories in the filepath must already exist.</p>

  <h1><a name="VP">Visited Pages</a></h1>

  <p>This allows you to change the appearance of the <a href=
  "visited_help.html">Visited Links Page</a> Normally it shows a
  list, in reverse order of the pages visited. The popup menu
  allows you these choices:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>By First Visit</em>: The default appearance, shows the
    pages based on when they were first visited. The list is shown
    in reverse order, to make the current page (usually) at the top
    of the list.</dt>

    <dt><em>By First Visit Reversed</em> The default appearance,
    shows the pages based on when they were first visited. The list
    is shown in order, to make the current page (usually) at the
    bottom of the list.</dt>

    <dt><em>As Visit Tree</em> Combines the first/last visited
    information, showing the list in order of the first visit, but
    using the indentation level of the page immediately previous to
    determine indentation of new entries. That gives a clue to the
    order of visiting pages when moving around in the History or
    Visited Pages lists.</dt>

    <dt><em>By Last Visit</em> The default appearance, shows the
    pages based on when they were last visited. The list is shown
    in reverse order, to make the current page (usually) at the top
    of the list.</dt>

    <dt><em>By Last Visit Reversed</em> The default appearance,
    shows the pages based on when they were last visited. The list
    is shown in order, to make the current page (usually) at the
    bottom of the list.</dt>
  </dl>

  <h1><a name="FT">FTP sort criteria</a></h1>

  <p>This allows you to specify how files will be sorted within FTP
  listings. The current options include `By&nbsp;Filename',
  `By&nbsp;Size', `By&nbsp;Type', `By&nbsp;Date'.</p>

  <h1><a name="LD">List directory style</a></h1>

  <p>Applies to Directory Editing. Files and directories can be
  presented in the following ways:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Mixed style</em>: Files and directories are listed
    together in alphabetical order.</dt>

    <dt><em>Directories first</em>: Files and directories are
    separated into 2 alphabetical lists: directories are listed
    first.</dt>

    <dt><em>Files first</em>: Files and directories are separated
    into 2 alphabetical lists: files are listed first.</dt>
  </dl>

  <h1><a name="DF">Show dot files</a></h1>

  <p>If display/creation of hidden (dot) files/directories is
  enabled, you can turn the feature on or off via this setting.</p>

  <h1><a name="PC">Preferred Document Charset</a></h1>

  <p>The character set you prefer if sets in addition to ISO-8859-1
  and US-ASCII are available from servers. Use MIME notation (e.g.,
  ISO-8859-2) and do not include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since
  those values are always assumed by default. Can be a
  comma-separated list, which may be interpreted by servers as
  descending order of preferences; you can make your order of
  preference explicit by using `q factors' as defined by the HTTP
  protocol, for servers which understand it: e.g., <kbd>iso-8859-5,
  utf-8;q=0.8</kbd>.</p>

  <h1><a name="PL">Preferred Document Language</a></h1>

  <p>The language you prefer if multi-language files are available
  from servers. Use RFC 1766 tags, e.g., `en' English, `fr' French.
  Can be a comma-separated list, and you can use `q factors' (see
  previous help item): e.g., <kbd>da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7</kbd>
  .</p>

  <h1><a name="UA">User Agent</a></h1>

  <p>The header string which Lynx sends to servers to indicate the
  User-Agent is displayed here. Changes may be disallowed via the
  -restrictions switch. Otherwise, the header can be changed
  temporarily to e.g., L_y_n_x/2.8.3 for access to sites which
  discriminate against Lynx based on checks for the presence of
  `Lynx' in the header. If changed during a Lynx session, the
  default User-Agent header can be restored by deleting the
  modified string in the Options Menu. Whenever the User-Agent
  header is changed, the current document is reloaded, with the
  no-cache flags set, on exit from Options Menu. Changes of the
  header are not saved in the .lynxrc file.</p>

  <p>NOTE Netscape Communications Corp. has claimed that false
  transmissions of `Mozilla' as the User-Agent are a copyright
  infringement, which will be prosecuted. DO NOT misrepresent Lynx
  as Mozilla. The Options Menu issues a warning about possible
  copyright infringement whenever the header is changed to one
  which does not include `Lynx' or `lynx'.</p>
