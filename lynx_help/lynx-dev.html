  <h1><em>The Lynx Development Process</em></h1>

  <p>Lynx is maintained and improved by an international
  co-operative of volunteers. Newcomers are welcome to join the
  group: you needn't be a super programmer, but you should be
  prepared to listen and learn, as well as to contribute patches if
  you can. Since everyone is a volunteer, you will usually be
  expected to try to implement any suggestions you make.</p>

  <h1><em>Lynx-Dev Discussion List</em></h1>

  <p>The developers communicate through a mailing list &mdash; see
  below for details &mdash; which is open to interested users as
  well as programmers. Topics include fixing bugs, increasing
  Lynx's tools and powers, meeting the ever-changing demands of the
  Internet and porting Lynx to new systems.</p>

  <p>Anyone may read what has been said on the list by visiting
  <a href=
  "http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lynx-dev/">&nbsp;the
  Archive</a>.</p>

  <h1><em>Development Versions of Lynx</em></h1>

  <p>Besides <em>releases</em>, which are stable versions of Lynx
  which come out once or twice a year and can be obtained from
  <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/release/">the release site</a>,
  there are <em>development</em> versions, which are experimental
  &mdash; though usually stable enough to use &mdash; and appear
  every few weeks, depending on current activity.</p>

  <p>You can find the latest <em>development</em> version of Lynx
  by visiting <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/current/">the
  development site</a>.</p>

  <h1><em>Subscribing to Lynx-Dev</em></h1>

  <p>If you are interested in joining the Lynx mailing list, send
  e-mail to <a href=
  "mailto:lynx-dev-request@nongnu.org?subject=subscribe">&nbsp;lynx-dev-request@nongnu.org</a>
  with "subscribe" as the subject line.</p>

  <p>You will need to answer one follow-up question to confirm you
  want to subscribe. Mailman will then enroll you and send all
  messages which you address to <em>lynx-dev@nongnu.org</em> to all
  subscribers; you will also receive all messages sent by other
  subscribers.</p>

  <h1><em>Unsubscribing from Lynx-Dev</em></h1>

  <p>To <em>unsubscribe</em>, send an e-mail to <a href=
  "mailto:lynx-dev-request@nongnu.org?subject=unsubscribe">&nbsp;lynx-dev-request@nongnu.org</a>
  with "unsubscribe" as the subject line.</p>

  <h1><em>Casual Inquiries</em></h1>

  <p>Anyone may ask a question or offer a comment by sending e-mail
  to <a href="mailto:lynx-dev@nongnu.org">&nbsp;the list</a>. Since
  all subscribers are volunteers, you depend on their goodwill and
  will be more likely to get a response if you give the e-mail a
  meaningful `Subject' and include details of your version of Lynx,
  hardware and software. You can check the Archive to find any
  responses.</p>

  <p>Messages from non-subscribers are not immediately distributed
  to avoid spam. Usually, if your message appears genuine, it will
  be retrieved from the pile headed for the wastebasket within a
  day or so and distributed to the list. For best results,
  subscribe as described above.</p>

  <h1><em>The Lynx-Dev Archive</em></h1>

  <p>Messages posted to lynx-dev are archived in html format so
  that you can view them using Lynx: go to the <a href=
  "http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lynx-dev/">Mail
  Archive</a>.</p>
