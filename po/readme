msgid "Fatal error - could not open output file %s\n" 
msgstr "" 
 
First line is a comment beginning with #, for your information. 
Original english string is <msgid>, do not change it. 
Translation in <msgstr>, empty string assume english default. 
Do not forget to include %s properly in your contributed translation! 
 
A good place to start is with the messages derived from LYMessages_en.h
