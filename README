WHAT IS LYNX?

   Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
   cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100
   terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
   character-cell display). It will display Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as
   well as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
   finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to
   telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts.  Current versions of Lynx run on
   Unix and VMS.
   
   Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to build
   information systems intended primarily for local access. For example,
   Lynx has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems
   (CWIS). In addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within
   a single LAN.
   
   For information about Lynx, including new updates, go to the
   			Lynx Enhanced Pages

   Lynx is distributed under the GNU General Public License without
   restrictions on usage or redistribution, and is supported by the
   Lynx user community.  See the accompanying COPYHEADER and COPYING
   files (in the about_lynx subdirectory) for more details.

   Certain portions of the Lynx source distribution were originally
   created by CERN and have been modified during the development of
   Lynx.  See WWW/Copyright.txt for copyright info regarding CERN
   products used in Lynx

DOCUMENTATION

   A users guide is included in this distribution along with a man page
   for Unix systems and a help file for VMS systems. All documentation is
   contained in this directory and the doc and samples subdirectories.
   
   While running Lynx, type 'h', 'H', or '?' to invoke the help menu
   system. From the help menu you may access several useful documents
   pertaining to Lynx and the World Wide Web. The most important of
   these is the Lynx Users Guide. By default, Lynx will use the Lynx
   Enhanced Pages, which includes http links for help and FAQs conerning
   Lynx. It is recommended that you install your own help menu system at
   your site in order to lessen the load on http servers. This also will
   allow you to customize the help menu system for your site.
   
   To install the help menu system, copy the lynx_help/ and about_lynx/
   directories to a public place on your system. Then, edit the lynx.cfg
   file so that the HELPFILE line is defined as follows:
   

      HELPFILE:file://localhost/[public_path]/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html

   where [public_path] is the absolute path to the lynx_help directory.
   
   Customizing the help menu system is just a matter of editing a set of
   HTML files.
   
INSTALLING LYNX

   To install Lynx, follow the steps listed in the INSTALLATION file
   located in the source distribution.
